        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to take input from the rotary encoder and display its value on three 7-segment displays. The rotary encoder outputs its value in gray code, so it must be converted to a binary value. To display this binary value, it must be converted to a binary-coded-decimal (BCD). Transistors must be used to cycle through the 7-segment displays in order to give the appearance of every display being on at once.            Parts List                         4-Bit Gray-Code Rotary Encoder      3× 7-Segment Display              CD4511BE BCD to 7-Segment Display IC      4× 1MΩ Resistor              3× 3904 NPN Transistor      3× 1kΩ Resistor              Arduino Uno             ProcedureThis challenge started by wiring the rotary encoder to an existing 7-segment BCD display circuit. The initial circuit consisted of a 4511 IC connected to three 7-segment displays. The displays achieved persistence of vision (POV) by toggling the ground connection through the use of NPN transistors. The wiring of the rotary encoder is nearly the same as that in Challenge 1 Rotary Switch Monitor.The real difference is in the output from the rotary encoder. Instead of returning a binary number according to the position of the rotor, the encoder used here returns a “Gray code” value. Gray code is very different from binary. Instead of being a “weighted” number system, wherein a change in a specific digit always has the same affect on a number, Gray code is unweighted. This makes it a code instead of a number system. The key feature of Gray code is that between each number only one bit changes value. When using binary, multiple bits often change from a 1 to a 0 while incrementing or decrementing number value. This reduces ambiguity between number states and, in extreme cases, can reduce wear on memory. At right is the bottom view of Gray code rotary encoder, with white squares being zeros and black squares representing ones.The code does the brunt of the work in this challenge. The code consists of three main parts. First, the program takes input from the rotary encoder attached to PORTD and converts the Gray code to a binary value. Next, the code converts this to a BCD value on r17 and r18. Finally the program displays these values on the 7-segment displays using POV. The code then loops to constantly poll the input states of the rotary encoder. In the first step of the input portion, the collect function stores the input state of PORTD to a register. It then shifts this register right, as the zero pin of PORTD does not have input, and the first input is instead on pin one. To convert the Gray code to binary, the convert function adds the binary value of the gray code input to the value of the x register and stores this in the z register. Next it queries the value stored at this position in memory. Here it returns a binary value equivalent to the Gray code. This is because the register stores the binary conversion of the Gray code at the index of the direct binary value of the gray code. For example, while Gray code 0b0011 is a two, the direct binary value is three.Next, the program converts the binary value to a BCD. Beginning at the loop label, the program shifts the input value left through the output registers, carrying the dropped value into each consecutive register. Here the iterate register decrements, as the algorithm must know whether or not the input number is fully converted or not. Next the program checks if the low bit of the first register is greater than or equal to three. The value of this register increases by three if this condition is true. The tens label repeats this step for the high bit of the first register. Instead, however, it checks if the register has a value greater than 80 (0x50) and adds 48 (0x30) if this condition is true. Again, this step repeats under the hundreds label, checking the low bit of the second register and adding three accordingly. Here it jumps back to the loop label. The input value is fully converted to BCD when the iterate register reaches zero.In the final part, the pov function takes the registers storing the BCD value and outputs the according number to the 4511 BCD to 7-segment display chip. The hundreds register displays first, with output on PORTC. Next, the base pin of the according transistor activates by setting PORTB. After displaying the hundreds digit, the tens digit is displayed by swapping the nibbles of the first register (r17), and repeating the steps for the hundreds register. The transistor select register shifts by one to enable the tens display and disable the hundreds display. Next, r17 swaps nibbles again and the above steps repeat, but for the ones digit. In the final step, the program jumps to the beginning of the program and the process repeats.

Unfortunately, I was not able to have operational code by the end of the challenge period. After working on my program throughout the week, however, I was able to get a working solution. My initial code was organized properly, but not operational. This challenge has adequately tested my knowledge of assembly code. It has also helped me develop my understanding of Gray code and a broader understanding on conversion algorithms/techniques.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “TEI4M Challenges.” ACES, RSGC, 15 Jan. 2018, darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/1718/Challenges.html#2.Grayhill. “Series 25L.” Grayhill.com, Digi-Key, www.grayhill.com/assets/1/7/Mech_Encoder_25L.pdf.",
