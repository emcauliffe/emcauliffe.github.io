        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to take input from the rotary encoder and display its value on three 7-segment displays. The rotary encoder outputs its value in gray code, so it must be converted to a binary value. To display this binary value, it must be converted to a binary-coded-decimal (BCD). Transistors must be used to cycle through the 7-segment displays in order to give the appearance of every display being on at once.            Parts List                         4-Bit Gray-Code Rotary Encoder      3× 7-Segment Display              CD4511BE BCD to 7-Segment Display IC      4× 1MΩ Resistor              3× 3904 NPN Transistor      3× 1kΩ Resistor              Arduino Uno             ProcedureThis challenge started by wiring the rotary encoder to an existing 7-segment BCD display circuit. The initial circuit consisted of a 4511 IC connected to three 7-segment displays. The displays achieved persistence of vision (POV) by toggling the ground connection through the use of NPN transistors. The wiring of the rotary encoder is nearly the same as that in Challenge 1 Rotary Switch Monitor.The real difference is in the output from the rotary encoder. Instead of returning a binary number according to the position of the rotor, the encoder used here returns a “Gray code” value. Gray code is very different from binary. Instead of being a “weighted” number system, wherein a change in a specific digit always has the same affect on a number, Gray code is unweighted. This makes it a code instead of a number system. The key feature of Gray code is that between each number only one bit changes value. When using binary, multiple bits often change from a 1 to a 0 while incrementing or decrementing number value. This reduces ambiguity between number states and, in extreme cases, can reduce wear on memory. At right is the bottom view of Gray code rotary encoder, with white squares being zeros and black squares representing ones.The code does the brunt of the work in this challenge. The code consists of three main parts. First, the program takes input from the rotary encoder attached to PORTD and converts the Gray code to a binary value. Next, the code converts this to a BCD value on r17 and r18. Finally the program displays these values on the 7-segment displays using POV. The code then loops to constantly poll the input states of the rotary encoder. In the first step of the input portion, the collect function stores the input state of PORTD to a register. It then shifts this register right, as the zero pin of PORTD does not have input, and the first input is instead on pin one. To convert the Gray code to binary, the convert function adds the binary value of the gray code input to the value of the x register and stores this in the z register. Next it queries the value stored at this position in memory. Here it returns a binary value equivalent to the Gray code. This is because the register stores the binary conversion of the Gray code at the index of the direct binary value of the gray code. For example, while Gray code 0b0011 is a two, the direct binary value is three.Next, the program converts the binary value to a BCD. Beginning at the loop label, the program shifts the input value left through the output registers, carrying the dropped value into each consecutive register. Here the iterate register decrements, as the algorithm must know whether or not the input number is fully converted or not. Next the program checks if the low bit of the first register is greater than or equal to three. The value of this register increases by three if this condition is true. The tens label repeats this step for the high bit of the first register. Instead, however, it checks if the register has a value greater than 80 (0x50) and adds 48 (0x30) if this condition is true. Again, this step repeats under the hundreds label, checking the low bit of the second register and adding three accordingly. Here it jumps back to the loop label. The input value is fully converted to BCD when the iterate register reaches zero.In the final part, the pov function takes the registers storing the BCD value and outputs the according number to the 4511 BCD to 7-segment display chip. The hundreds register displays first, with output on PORTC. Next, the base pin of the according transistor activates by setting PORTB. After displaying the hundreds digit, the tens digit is displayed by swapping the nibbles of the first register (r17), and repeating the steps for the hundreds register. The transistor select register shifts by one to enable the tens display and disable the hundreds display. Next, r17 swaps nibbles again and the above steps repeat, but for the ones digit. In the final step, the program jumps to the beginning of the program and the process repeats.Media                                      Fritzing diagram    Circuit overview                                        Proper operation showing output 14    Bottom of rotary encoder        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/K7AFz38Lux8  Code; GrayCodeChallenge.asm;; Created: 2018-01-15 8:57:57 AM; Author : Ethan McAuliffe.def\titerate = r24.def\ttemp  = r25.def\tthree = r23.def\tthreeTens = r22.cseg.org 0x0000   rjmp  reset;segment table format: ;gfab_cde..org 0x0010grayStart:  .DB\t0,1,3,2,7,6,4,5,15,14,12,13,8,9,11,10grayEnd:reset:\tldi   r16, low(RAMEND)\t\t;ALL assembly code should start by\tout   spl,r16\t\t\t\t      ; setting the Stack Pointer to\tldi   r16, high(RAMEND)\t\t; the end of SRAM to support\tout   sph,r16\t\t\t\t      ; function calls, etc.\tldi   xl,low(grayStart&lt;&lt;1)\t;position X and Y pointers to the\tldi   xh,high(grayStart&lt;&lt;1)\t;start and end addresses of\tldi   yl,low(grayEnd&lt;&lt;1)   ; our data table, respectively\tldi   yh,high(grayEnd&lt;&lt;1)\tmovw  z,x\t                 ;start Z pointer off at the start address of the table.\tldi r16,0x1E\tout DDRD,r16\t\t\t\tldi r16,0x07\tout DDRB,r16\t\t\t;pins to control transistors\tldi r16,0x0F\tout DDRC,r16\t\t\t;pins to control 7-segment driver    collect:\tclr r16\tclr r17\tclr r18\tin r16,PIND\t\t\t;store input from rotary encoder\tlsr r16\t\t\t    ;shift right to get gray code\tmovw z,r16\t\t\t;move to element the gray code is in binary\tadd zl,xl\tlpm r18,z\t\t\t  ;store fetched binary valueconvert:\tmov r16,r18\tldi iterate, 8\tldi three, 0x03\tldi threeTens, 0x30\tclr r17\tclr r18loop:   rol r16   rol r17   rol r18\t\t\t\t;shift value and BCD registers with carry   dec iterate\t\t\t   breq pov\t\t\t\t;jump to POV if there are no bits left to convert   mov temp, r17\t\t\t\t\t   andi temp, 0x0F\t\t\t\t\t   cpi temp, 0x05\t\t\t   brlo tens        ;skip to tens if value is less than 5\t\t   add r17,three    ;otherwise add threetens:   cpi temp, 0x50\t\t\t   brlo hundreds   add r17,threeTenshundreds:   andi temp, 0x0F   cpi temp, 0x50\t\t\t   brlo loop   add r18, threerjmp looppov:\tout PORTC,r18\t\t\t;output hundreds value\tldi r16,0x04\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable hundreds 7-seg disp\trcall delay\tlsr r16\tswap r17\tout PORTC,r17\t\t\t;output tens value\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable tens 7-seg disp\trcall delay\tlsr r16\tswap r17\tout PORTC,r17\t\t\t;output ones value\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable ones 7-seg disp\trcall delayrjmp collectdelay:; Generated by delay loop calculator; at http://www.bretmulvey.com/avrdelay.html;; Delay 16 000 cycles; 1ms at 16 MHz    ldi  r19, 21    ldi  r20, 199L1: dec  r20    brne L1    dec  r19    brne L1retConclusionTo conclude, I am satisfied with the final result of this project. Unfortunately, I was not able to have operational code by the end of the challenge period. After working on my program throughout the week, however, I was able to get a working solution. My initial code was organized properly, but not operational. This challenge has adequately tested my knowledge of assembly code. It has also helped me develop my understanding of Gray code and a broader understanding on conversion algorithms/techniques.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “TEI4M Challenges.” ACES, RSGC, 15 Jan. 2018, darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/1718/Challenges.html#2.Grayhill. “Series 25L.” Grayhill.com, Digi-Key, www.grayhill.com/assets/1/7/Mech_Encoder_25L.pdf.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this challenge is to create a circuit to light up a bicolour LED a specific colour depending on the position of a rotary decoder. The project works by reading the value of a  rotary encoder connected to an ATtiny85, then determining if said number has an odd or even number of set bits and displaying the appropriate colour on the LED. If the number of set bits is even, the LED will show red. Otherwise, it will be green. A resistor network provides appropriate pull down resistors for the input from the rotary encoder. The led should change colour immediately depending on the value of the rotary encoder.

Positive voltage connected to the common pin and the binary outputs connected to the resistor network. The resistor network provides a pull down resistance for the outputs of the rotary encoder. These outputs also connected to the input pins of the ATtiny85. Pin 1 connected to PORTB0, 2 to PORTB1 and 4 to PORTB2. This meant that the first 3 bits of PORTB represented the same value as shown on the rotary encoder. At right is the pinout of said rotary encoder. A bicolour LED is also connected to the ATtiny85 on pins PORTB3 and PORTB4, where the longer lead is in PORTB3.The next step was programming the ATtiny85 to read the binary value presented on its pins, determine the number of set bits, and display the appropriate LED colour. The program first enables output on PORTB pins 2 and 3 in the start label. Next, the microcontroller imports the high/low values on PORTB to a register using the in instruction. An andi instruction strips the highest 4 bits from this value and each bit is then tested to be either a one or a zero. If the bit is a one, the value on a separate register increases by one. If bit zero of this external register is a zero, the number of set bits is even, and the program jumps to the isEven label. This label calls the green function, and then returns to the load label to ensure constant monitoring of the rotary encoder value. If said value is odd, the same occurs but with the isOdd label and red function.Media                                      3D Render of circuit    Photo of circuit                                        Rotary encoder used in circuit    Fritzing Diagram        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/-HsjXjVvNDY  Code; Challenge 1.asm; Created: 2017-12-01 1:58:44 PM; Author : Ethan McAuliffe#define TEST_BIT 0b00001111; Replace with your application codestart:\tldi r16,0x18\tout 0x17,r16\tclr r16load:\tclr r16\tin r16,0x16again:\tandi r16,0x0F\tmov r18,r16\t\t;copy\tldi r17,11\t\t;mask\tand r18,r17\t\t;test\tsbrc r18,0\tinc r19\tasr r16\tbrne againsbrc r19, 0rjmp isOddrjmp isEvenisOdd:\trcall red\trjmp loadisEven:\trcall green\trjmp loadgreen:\tldi r16,0x10\tout 0x18,r16\tretred:\tldi r16,0x08\tout 0x18,r16\tretConclusionTo conclude, I am somewhat disappointed with the result of this project. While I was able to complete the code for the project in the allotted time, I did not get as many photos as I should and was not able to record any video of its operation. While my 3D render animation is effective at displaying what a similar circuit would look like, I would rather have video that I could use to explain the fundamental workings of my project. Furthermore, my code has switched up the colour of the LED to be displayed; when the number of set bits are even, my code sets the LED green LED instead of red. I did, however, find the challenge to be quite enjoyable. I liked being pushed to delve deep into the ATtiny85 datasheet and AVR instruction set. I do believe that I learned a lot from the completion of this challenge.ReferenceAtmel Corporation. Atmel ATtiny25, ATtiny45, ATtiny85 Datasheet.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of how relays work and how early computer logic was able to use relays before the invention of transistors. The end product also aims to be simple and easy to operate for potential students and their parents touring the Design Engineering Studio (DES). Finally, the end product aims to sound pleasing to the ear by performing a series of satisfying mechanical clicks when operated.The adder is to combine the sum of nine inputs, each of which being a power of two, into a binary output. The maximum sum value is 31. The calculator is capable of producing a possible 32 (25) unique sums (where zero is an acceptable sum). Each switch will add either a 2, 4, 6 or 8 to the total.

The planning and idea brainstorming came after choosing relays to be a main component. After researching historic use of relays as logic capable devices, the chosen project would be a modular full adder circuit.Testing and research on creating logic gates with relays, specifically the NAND logic gate, proceeded the planned idea. NAND gates are important for logic operations as they can create any of the other logic gates when organized in specific ways. This testing and planning is similar to Project 2. Digital (Transistor-Based) Logic Gates, but with relays instead of transistors.The next step was creating a half adder with NAND logic using relays. The half adder is a circuit which takes two separate inputs and returns a sum, in binary, of those outputs on two pins, the SUM (Σ) and CARRY OUT pins. For example, if both outputs are high, the sum is a decimal two, represented by a low output on the Σ pin (as there are zero groups of 20) and a high output on the CARRY OUT pin (as there is one group of 21). After testing this circuit and reproducing it in EAGLE, the circuit needed further modifications to transform it into a full adder. Accomplishing this consists of chaining two half adder circuits together and performing a logical OR on the two CARRY OUT pins. The chaining of half adders works by connecting the Σ pin of the first half adder to an input on the second and adding a CARRY IN pin which connects to the second input of the second half adder. Now that a CARRY IN pin is present, the circuit is an operational full adder and it is possible to chain it with other identical full adders to work as a calculator (that only does addition).  The design and fabrication of a custom PCB followed the creation of a full adder circuit diagram in EAGLE (PCB shown right, link to schematic image: https://goo.gl/cXBRqa). The next step, after the arrival of the PCBs, was soldering the components to the board and testing operation. This includes soldering yellow relays in such a way that the four boards together spell out the word “ACES”.The next step was designing the LED holder (present below at right) and the clips used to mount the PCBs. Using Fusion 360 for design and the Ultimaker 3 for fabrication made this easy and efficient. This step included multiple iterations of the PCB clip design. The final product has an aesthetically pleasing symmetry, is easy to use and is strong.The next step is attaching the parts to the plywood board with the intention of making the final project both visually appealing and easy to use. This step consists of gluing the PCBs down using the custom designed clips and drilling holes through to the other side of the board to hide wires. It also includes soldering switches to power rails, chaining the CARRY OUT and CARRY IN pins of consecutive boards together, connecting the LEDs to the outputs of the full adder PCBs and labeling specific components for ease of use. The final step is connecting the full adder PCBs to the respective switch inputs. The project is now complete.Media                                      Circuit board render with clips    Yellow relays soldered on boards A &amp; C                                        Final Product    Output showing value of \"11\"        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/ibXhrRucC1A  ConclusionIn conclusion, I am happy with the result of this project. I enjoyed working with relays, despite them not being my initial choice in the Yankee Swap. This project had the unique benefit of being a mini history lesson too. I learned, through research online, how relays used to be found in nearly all electronics prior to the widespread use of vacuum tubes and transistors. Through this project I also learned why relays are never used in logic applications anymore: they use a lot of power, are very expensive and are at risk of mechanical failure. I am also happy with the appearance of my final project and am happy that it is going to be displayed in the lab for potential and younger students to get excited about electronics. While there are many skills that this project did not require (coding being the most significant), I still believe that this project was a resounding success.ReferenceLekule, Sostenes. “A Full-Adder.” LEKULE BLOG, 21 Apr. 2015, http://sosteneslekule.blogspot.ca/2015/04/a-full-adder.html.“Relay Logic Gates.” Electro-Tech-Online.com, http://www.electro-tech-online.com/attachments/upload_2015-6-18_21-28-8-png.92993/.",

The clock is to read the time off of an Real Time Clock (RTC) IC, read air pressure, humidity and temperature wirelessly from a separate device, and display everything in an easy to understand way. To display the time, words for each five minute interval and each hour are to illuminate. To display the current temperature and relative humidity percentage (%RH), the first ten columns are to light up and show the required digits, similar to a 7-segment display.

This step also requires careful planning of the order that words will appear to ensure readability (top to bottom, left to right) and that there is adequate spacing between each word. Each line must also have the same number of characters, and the “C” and “%” characters must be present only in the far-right column. Creation of the design initially began in a text file, and was then transferred to a table in a word document to add colour. Creation of the final design required using a CAD program, in this case ViaCAD 3D, to ensure proper spacing of characters. Mr. Elia helped greatly with this. The final step in designing the clock face was sending the design files off to be laser cut in acrylic and plastic. Assembly began when the laser cut pieces arrived. Gluing the characters  into place meant ensuring that the block shape of each was clear acrylic, and the inner “floating” parts of the characters were the same black plastic as the rest of the clock face. This allowed for avoiding a stencil font while still maintaining readability. Creating the wireless weather sensor was the next step. This began with reading the datasheet to understand where to find data on the IC and how to access it using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Pictured on the previous page is the pinout for the BME280 sensor. It is a surface mount device.SPI works similar to serial communication, but with the added benefit of the slave device (in this case the BME280 sensor) being able to contact the master device as well (in this case the Arduino Uno). Unlike I2C, it requires 4 pins. See Wireless Communication: Temperature Data Logging for more information on Serial Communication. SPI is the chosen protocol in this case because it means using only one communication protocol to interact with the wireless transmitter and the weather sensor.Configuring the BME280 chip is important so that that reports the values as desired. The sensorConfig()  function configures the sensor by performing a reset, identifying how often the sensor is to record information, and how sensitive the sensor should be to sudden changes in values. It also initiates getCompensationData().The data from the BME280 chip requires processing before it can accurately display the time. This is because each individual chip has different sensitivities to the environment. The manufacturer, Bosch, solves this problem by storing “compensation data” in specific registers on the chip. The getCompensationData() function in the Remote Sensor code obtains this data. The getCompensationData() function is only called once as the compensation data never changes. A special struct called compData stores this data because some values have different lengths, some are “signed” and some are “unsigned”. This was problematic as the datasheet provided incorrect information on which characters were signed or unsigned. by comparing the individual compensation data readouts to those of the Adafruit library, it was easy to deduce which were incorrect.Signed characters use format called Two’s Compliment to store their values. Using an 8-bit byte as an example, two’s compliment has the ability to store a value ranging from -128 to 127 inclusive. Two’s compliment works by accepting a positive integer from 0-128, then performing a bitwise “NOT”, and adding 1. This value now represents a negative integer. The computer can tell that the value is negative, because the most significant bit of binary integer is a “1”. For more information on bitwise, see the BiColour LED Matrix project.Recording the uncompensated, or “raw”, data from the sensor happens after reading the compensation data. The getRawData() function obtains said data and stores it in a struct called rawData. This data is then run through specific algorithms defined in the datasheet, which use the compensation data recorded earlier, to get the temperature in degrees Celsius, the pressure in Pascals, and the relative humidity percentage. These algorithms are temp(), pressure() and humidity() for temperature, pressure and humidity respectively. Each returns a value of specific size for easy formatting and transmission using the transmit() function.The transmit() function compacts the temperature, pressure and humidity data into one unsigned, 64-bit integer, and transmits it wirelessly via the NRF24L01+. The program then uses the deepSleep() function to enter the peripherals into low power mode, wait, and then turn the sensor back on. This function uses SPI to write to a specific register on the BME280 sensor requesting that it enter sleep mode.The clock code first uses I2C to intercept the current hour and minute from the DS1307 RTC. This code is works almost identically to that used in the Nixie Tube Clock project. The updateTime() function obtains this time and stores it in a struct called currentTime for easy access. This function also converts the 24-hour time stored on the RTC into 12-hour time for the clock to display.The receive() function then looks for available data from the remote sensor, formats the recieved 64 bit, unsigned integer into temperature, pressure and humidity again, and then stores it in a struct called senseData.The current time is then formatted into specific words and printed to the serial monitor via the printTimeAndData() function. This function first reads the current minute and maps it to a value from 0-12, inclusive. This value is then used to query the minuteText[] array and determine what text to show for the current minute. Next the function determines if the clock should display “TO” or “PAST” the hour. The clock only switches to “TO” after 35 minutes of the current hour have elapsed. The mapped value is again used to determine this. The final step in showing the current time is displaying the appropriate hour in relation to the current time. For this the current hour value minus one (because arrays are zero indexed) index of thehourText[] array prints to the serial monitor. If the minutes, however, are greater than 35, the clock must display the future hour as the clock will now show “TO” instead of “PAST”. As such the index of the current hour is directly indexed into the hourText[] array. Finally the function prints the data intercepted from the remote sensor to the serial monitor. This includes whether or not the weather is improving, or worsening.The isWeatherImproving() function uses an average of the pressure from each five minute interval over the past hour plus the current pressure and compares it against the oldest pressure reading. If the average is less than the oldest reading, pressure is decreasing  and the weather is getting worse. Otherwise, the weather is improving and the function returns true.While simple at first, numerous obstacles faced the construction of this clock later on. Cutting the perfectly square back plate of the clock and wooden borders of the face plate was the first step. Gluing the cardstock baffles which ensured no light bleed from neighbouring characters followed. This ensured that the clock would be easy to read. Problems arose in the final steps when planning out a NeoPixel LED matrix for backlighting, as the NeoPixels were non-functional. BiColour Red/Green LEDs replaced the NeoPixels after a last-minute visit to a hardware store. Unfortunately, however, the ATmega328P does not have enough ports to control the 93 LED matrix, and as such, the clock cannot function. Painting the clock and gluing the faceplate in position were the final steps. A possible solution to this problem would be a larger Arduino device to control the entire matrix, or (the better option) to purchase a working strip of NeoPixels.Media                                      Drilling holes for LEDs    Soldering LED matrix                                        Testing Main clock module without matrix    Illuminated Clock Face        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/0zP5Rlmc7oA  CodeMain Clock Code#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#include &lt;nRF24L01.h&gt;#include &lt;printf.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24_config.h&gt;#define RTC_ADDRESS 0x68RF24 radio(9, 10);uint8_t addresses[][6] = {\"3g8wM\", \"0Us9x\"};uint64_t data;bool goodWeather;String hourText[] = {\"ONE\", \"TWO\", \"THREE\", \"FOUR\", \"FIVE\", \"SIX\", \"SEVEN\", \"EIGHT\", \"NINE\", \"TEN\", \"ELEVEN\", \"TWELVE\"};String minuteText[] = {\"\", \"FIVE\", \"TEN\", \"A QUARTER\", \"TWENTY\", \"TWENTY FIVE\", \"A HALF\", \"TWENTY FIVE\", \"TWENTY\", \"A QUARTER\", \"TEN\", \"FIVE\", \"\"};uint32_t pressureAverage[13];uint8_t durationThroughHour;struct SENSORDATA {  int8_t temp;

I did enjoy working with ViaCAD to create a clean, accurate final product, and while it may not work as intended, it does look quite nice. This project taught me to always test your components before you leave the lab for a long weekend. While I am wholeheartedly disappointed with the results this far, I am optimistic that I can get this project to achieve its intended purpose. While it was quite difficult, I enjoyed working with only the SPI library to communicate with the BME280 chip as it taught me more about the SPI protocol, how data is stored in peripherals, and how to read (and find issues with) datasheets. I have alerted Bosch of the issue with their datasheet and they have yet alerted me of a change. From the issue with the NeoPixels, I learned how to think quickly and produce a final project with some resemblance to the intended final product. I hope to bring what I learned about communication protocols, sensors, data compensation algorithms and limitations of certain products with me for utilization in future projects.Reference“BME280.” Bosch Sensortec, Bosch, 26 Oct. 2015, http://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-11.pdf.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to learn about low-level port manipulation using the ATtiny84 and a homemade bicolour LED matrix display. The LED matrix is to show a unique and challenging pattern. This project incorporates persistence of vision (POV), switching quickly between red and green to create a yellow colour and code that uses bitwise operators. The animations used will consist of a square counting down from four to zero, then a red dot flashing in sync with a buzzer; a series of firework-like explosion animations wherein the LEDs flash outwards in a cross from an origin; and a yellow sunrise and sunset animation.            Parts List                         ATtiny84 Through-Hole Microcontroller      16 × Red-Green BiColour LEDs              Piezo buzzer      AVR Pocket Programmer              AVR Programmer Breakout Board      Heat-Shrink Tubing              4 × Male to Female Jumper Wires             ProcedureThis project begins by soldering the LED matrix together using the 3D-Printed matrix jig (seen bottom right). The arrangement of the LEDs requires them to be in a particular orientation as to connect all the short pins and long pins together. They must be in this arrangement so that the code can address individual LEDs. Heat shrink tubing on each of the anode pins prevents them from short-circuiting with the bare cathode pins soldered beneath and displaying a unwanted pattern. Building the matrix requires the testing of each LED to ensure operation and prevent non-functional “pixels” on the matrix. Coloured heat shrink tubing added to the ends of the matrix pins differentiate the anode pins of each colour.The code consists of four separate patterns: countDownSquare(), explodeMatrix(), sunrise(),sunset(). Code uploading utilizes the AVR Pocket Programmer.To begin, the countDownSquare() function displays a 2×2 square of green LEDs in the middle of the matrix. The function then uses POV to iterate through a series of display outputs. The POV used in this project utilizes the ability to set each individual port on each individual bus to input or output using the Data Direction Register (DDR). When a pin is set to output, it is either ground or VCC. When it is set to input, however, it is essentially “hanging” and will not ground or supply any voltage. This is how it is possible to individually address LEDs. The function continues the countdown, and then shows a blinking red LED in conjunction with a buzzer. The explodeMatrix() function is a special loop that calls the main fireworks() function with every individual LED as an origin point. The fireworks() function iterates through a loop itself where it fills the matrix with a specific colour, but uses the DDR to disable particular LEDs. The function uses the logical OR operator (see Project 2) on each individual bit (called bitwise) to calculate the required value in the DDR and show only the requested LED. By adding the loop variable to the specified startingLEDY and startingLEDX, the loop uses POV to light up LEDs in a outward moving “cross” pattern, thus simulating a firework-like explosion.Finally, the sunrise() function utilises the sunriseDDR[] array to demonstrate that arrays can store patterns. First, the program iterates through a while() to ensure that specific display values appear for an accurate duration of time. The countDownSquare() function uses a similar loop to display POV patterns. The while() loop iterates through each element setting DDRA equal to the value of said element. Using the sunriseFrames variable in the loop prevents it from exceeding the maximum length of the array and breaking the pattern. To finish, the code iterates through the sunriseDDR[] array in reverse to show the sunset animation. The code then loops through the four patterns again.Media                                      Testing patterns on the matrix    countDownSquare() animation                                        AVR Programmer Breakout Board properly assembled    Final solder job of the BiColour LED Matrix        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/5sFCJA86BtU  Code#define RED 1uint8_t sunriseDDR[] = {0x16, 0x36, 0x36, 0x66, 0xC6};//sunrise value arrayuint8_t sunriseFrames = sizeof(sunriseDDR) / sizeof(uint8_t); //calculates length of sunrise array in bytesvoid setup() {  DDRA = 0xFF;//preemptively enables output for all matrix ports  DDRB = 1 &lt;&lt; PORTB2;//enables specific port on PORTB for buzzer}void loop() {  countDownSquare(100);  explodeMatrix();  sunrise(100);  sunset(100);}void countDownSquare(uint16_t countSpeed) {  DDRA = 0x66;  PORTA = 0x60; //full green square  delay(countSpeed);  uint16_t povTime = millis();  while (povTime + 200 &gt;= millis()) { //shows POV of 3 dots in centre of matrix    DDRA = 0x22;    PORTA = 0x20; //bottom left green dot    DDRA = 0x64;    PORTA = 0x60; //two green line left  }  DDRA = 0x64;//shows 2 dots on left side of matrix  delay(countSpeed);  DDRA = 0x44;// shows upper left dot  delay(countSpeed);  DDRA = 0x44; // keeps red dot in sync with other dots to be displayed  PORTA ^= 0xFF; //invert colours of top left dot  DDRA ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTA2;  for (uint8_t i; i &lt; 8; i++) {    PORTB ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTB2;//turns on and off the buzzer    DDRA ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTA2; //turn on and off the top left dot    delay(countSpeed);  }  DDRB = 0x00; //turn off port as interference from other ports can cause noise in the buzzer}void firework(uint8_t explosionSpeed, uint8_t startingLEDY, uint8_t startingLEDX) {  matrix(RED);  for (uint8_t i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i++) {    uint16_t povDuration = millis() + explosionSpeed;    while (povDuration &gt;= millis()) { // uses POV and loop to show \"explosion\" animation where lit LEDs move out in a cross from the original LED      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY + i | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX;      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY - i | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX;      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX + i;      (startingLEDX - i) &lt; 0 ?

This project helped me understand how the microcontroller interprets the functions that I write to it in normal Arduino code. It gave me a certain level of respect for those who write the functions that help beginners learn the basics of coding and keep them motivated. This project also taught me the “low-level” equivalent of LED matrices, wherein the LEDs have to be arranged in a certain way and the leads have to be kept separate in order to have the matrix work as intended. I am happy to have overcome the challenges I had in this project and am excited to bring my newfound knowledge with me for use in future endeavours. ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “2016-2017 TEI3M Challenges - BiColor LED Matrix.” RSGC ACES, RSGC, http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI3M/1617/Challenges.html#BiColorLEDMatrix.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create a clock that displays the current time, in a 24h format, on 4 nixie tubes. The clock is to show the accurate time, despite power loss, and have only one power supply.

Next, the idea developed a true project with the purchase of nixie tubes and BCD chips on eBay. The creation of a possible schematic occurred as the parts were in the mail. The schematic in question contained a boost converter circuit as well as the nixie tube and driver circuitry. The boost converter in the original circuit was not successful as the capacitors inside the MOSFET interfered with the PWM signal of the ATmega328P and fried it. Next was building a 555 boost converter, which increased voltage to desired levels, but could not sustain load. Instead, an eBay boost converter specifically designed for nixie tubes was purchased.Code writing started as soon as the nixie tubes and BCD chips arrived. The programming of the chronodot started the adventure into coding a clock. First, the code calls the hex data for the current hour minute and second from the chronodot using the Wire.read() function.The readTime function formats this data into a human-readable decimal value. Next, the decimal values get fed into the timeData function. This function takes the decimal values and, using the toNibble function, creates a 16 digit long string of 1s and 0s. Each digit in the string represents an output on the shift register and each group of 4 digits, or binary nibble, represents a digit on the clock. The toNibble function takes the binary value of a digit and creates a string exactly 4 digits long.After formatting the current time in a way that the shift registers and BCD chips can read, the shiftTime function sends this data out. The shiftTime function runs through an entire string and sends the corresponding data to the shift registers.Shift registers use 3 pins to receive information from a device like the ATMega 328P. These pins are the serial data, serial clock and latch pins. The shift register indexes a “1” in its memory when the serial data pin is high and, after that, the serial clock pin is high. If the serial data pin is low and the serial clock pin has been set to high, the shift register indexes a “0”. Finally, after receiving all the desired data, the latch pin is set high and the outputs of the shift register change to reflect the data received. The shiftTime function reads the string of 1s and 0s representing the current time and sends this data to the shift registers.These shift registers connect to К155ИД1 (K155ID1) binary to decimal converter chips. These chips take the binary nibble and ground the appropriate output pins. The pins ground incoming current because they are specially designed for ИН-14 (IN-14) nixie tubes, which have a common anode.Nixie tubes work by lighting a filament inside a glass chamber filled with gas. This gas often consists of neon and some mercury or argon. They need 150V-170V to run and can run off AC or DC. The digits are completely separate from each other and, as such, multiple digits can appear concurrently as in the picture to the right. These specific tubes were manufactured in the USSR and used as numerical displays before the invention of the 7 segment layout.The final additions to the code were a daylight savings time switch and the cycleTubes function. The DST switch allows for a user to efficiently move the hour forward and back on demand. The cycleTubes function gets called every hour, on the hour, to prevent cathode poisoning on the nixie tubes. Cathode poisoning occurs when a digit is on for a prolonged period of time. The coating on this digit sprays onto nearby digits resulting in dimmer patches and less clear numbers. Cycling through all the possible displays once an hour, prevents this.The final addition was the boost converter to power the nixies. Each tube was individually tested for operation and connected to the circuit. A 47KΩ resistor placed on the anodes of each tube to prevents high current from frying the BCD chips. The addition of a 5V voltage regulator allowed the logical components and the nixies to share the same singular power source. The clock was now complete.Media                                      Demonstrating the layering of digits on a Nixie Tube. \"6\" is illuminated here.    130V-170V DC Boost Converter Circuit                                        Accurate time displaying on the clock    Nixie tubes at night        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/cuN6FGU5eqE  CodeMain Clock Code//Name: Ethan McAuliffe//Date: 2016-12-17//Project: Nixie Tube Clock//Status: Functional and Tested//Libraries#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;//Constants#define serial 2#define latch 3#define clk 4#define DSTPin 9#define rtc 0x68//VariablesString currentTime; // current time formatted for the shift registersint8_t daylight; //daylight savings offsetuint8_t cHour; //current houruint8_t cMinute; //current minuteuint8_t cSecond;  //current secondvoid setup() {  Wire.begin();  pinMode(serial, OUTPUT);  pinMode(latch, OUTPUT);  pinMode(clk, OUTPUT);  pinMode(DSTPin, INPUT_PULLUP);}void loop() {  //Interface with the RTC  Wire.beginTransmission(rtc);  Wire.write(0); //prepare rtc to be read from  Wire.endTransmission();  Wire.requestFrom(rtc, 7);  while (Wire.available() == 0);  //read current  minute and hour  cSecond = readTime(Wire.read());//second  cMinute = readTime(Wire.read() &amp; 0x7f); //minute  cHour = readTime(Wire.read() &amp; 0x3f); //hour  //if the daylight savings time switch is on, add add 1 hour to the current time  digitalRead(DSTPin) == LOW ?

I enjoyed working with even higher voltages than my previous project, despite being shocked more than a few times. It was fun to learn how to use niche devices to create a device that we use multiple times a day. I also learned some electronic history by reading up on nixie tubes and why they were used. I fully intend to extend this project further and create a custom circuit board using EAGLE as well as designing an enclosure using ViaCAD. I also intend to finally decode the mystery of boost converters (although I believe I know where I went wrong). I put an immense amount of time into this project, but I do not believe that any of it was wasted. I am very much satisfied with my final product.ReferenceAlberto. “ATMEGA328 &amp; Arduino Pinout Diagram.” PighiXXX, 18 Feb. 2013, http://v.gd/miZ3gY.Boxall, John. “Using DS1307 and DS3231 Real-Time Clock Modules with Arduino.” Tronixstuff, Tronixlabs, 1 Dec. 2014, http://tronixstuff.com/2014/12/01/tutorial-using-ds1307-and-ds3231-real-time-clock-modules-with-arduino/.Harrison, Mike. “Nixie Power Supply.” Mike’s Electric Stuff, http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/nixpsu.html.“IN-14 (ИН-14) Datasheet.” TubeHobby, Gazotron, http://tubehobby.com/datasheets/in14.pdf.“K155ID1 (К155ИД1) Datasheet.” TubeHobby, CCCP, http://tubehobby.com/datasheets/k155id1.pdf.Onno. “Neon Nostalgia.” Neon Nostalgia, 20 Oct. 2000, http://www.glowbug.nl/neon/index.html.Urbach, Claus-Dieter. “FAQ Nixietubes.” NixieClocks.de, http://www.nixieclocks.de/FAQ_Nixietubes.pdf.",
