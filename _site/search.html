        "content": "End of year 2018 grade 12 physics ISP.What is a Muon?A muon is a charged subatomic particle similar to an electron. It shares the same properties of an electron except that it weight considerably more than an electron. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a muon weight 207 times more than an electron. Muons originate in the upper reaches of the atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with atoms. They are part of a group of subatomic particles called leptons. This group of particle is unique in that it does not directly react with other particles or nuclei. Thanks to this property, muons are able to pass through solid objects. Instead, muons decay through the “weak force”, a fundamental force in particle physics. The half-life of a muon is 2.2µs according to UC Berkeley. This is shorter than the time that it takes for a muon traveling at near light speed to reach the surface of the earth. The reason we are able to detect them, however, is because of relativity. The muon’s half-life is measured in its own reference frame. This means that the closer the muon travels to the speed of light, the longer its lifespan and the more likely it is to reach earth’s surface. Muon detectors have been used recently to detect cavities in the Great Pyramids. Underneath these cavities, the rate of muon detection is greater than areas of solid brick. Muons are also being used to detect nuclear devices from great distances. The radioactive materials used in nuclear weapons production are very good at scattering muons in a detectable pattern.How does the circuit work?Unfortunately, the circuit does not currently function. I believe this to be caused by the scintillator glass being less than optically perfect. The solution to this problem would be to heat up the glass with a hot-air device, melting the surface layer of the plastic and letting it reset. This would produce a perfectly flat, optically perfect layer. According to the user guide, this could possibly solve the problem of low detection rates. I have been able to detect muons beyond the first iteration of the program, however they have not appeared at the 0.5 Hz frequency that the CosmicWatch guide says that I should expect. Worst case scenario the SiMP (silicon photomultiplier) is on the wrong way around, in which I would simply have to desolder, turn it around and then re-solder it in place.The other issue is the display. For some strange reason the code contains a setting for the reset line of the display as if the creators knew it would require one, and yet there is no appropriate header for this line. This may be the problem that is preventing the display from showing information. Nonetheless, the program will still work when connected to a computer. Thanks to the serial output of the Arduino Nano, I am able to see when the program detects a muon and all the associated information with it.Despite the non-functional circuit, the circuit is still simple to explain. There are four important parts: the detector (SiMP PCB), the DC-DC booster, the amplifier, the peak-detector and the Arduino nano.The SiMP PCB is very straightforward and consists solely of passive components. A series of resistors and capacitors interface with the two contacts of the SiMP. These resistors and capacitors work together to form high and low-pass filters (as to prevent external noise from interfering with the circuit). The sensor requires 29.5V to function properly. While there are six pins connected to the main board, only three serve a purpose. These three pins are: VCC(29.5V DC), ground and signal. VCC connects to the voltage booster and signal connects to the amplifying circuit.The DC-DC booster converts the input +5V from the Arduino or barrel jack to the +29.5V required by the sensL SiMP. These circuits, also called boost converters, work using the relationship between electrical current and magnetic fields. The booster IC regulates a short-current across a coil. This creates a current spike through the coil and generates an electromagnetic field. When the IC turns off this “short-current”, this field collapses, creating a voltage spike, and is dumped into accompanying capacitors. Here this capacitor is 0.47µF. This switching occurs so quickly that the capacitor never drops below 29.5V. It is important that this circuit have a feedback loop that informs the IC when the circuit is bearing load. If there is no feedback, the voltage will drop as soon as load is applied. This is because the IC is not increasing the duration of the short-current and thus the cap is draining too quickly for the voltage to be sustained.The amplifier is based off of a simple operational-amplifier (OP-Amp) IC. This IC compares the signal voltage coming from the SiMP to 5V and adjusts the output accordingly. Essentially, this circuit is taking the small voltage variations coming from the SiMP and boosting them. This is different from the DC-DC boost converter as it requires a high-voltage supply (in this case 5V) and the output does not bear load. The amplification factor of this circuit is 10x.The peak detector is also based off of an OP-Amp. In fact, they both use the same IC that contains two separate OP-Amps. This saves space and reduces cost. The peak detector compares the input signal to the “previous” input signal through the use of two diodes, two resistors and a capacitor. The amplified signal travels through the second op-amp through a diode and into a capacitor. The voltage level of this capacitor is always close to the highest amplified signal of the SiMP. This is because the resistors connected to the capacitor which drain it are of a very high resistance. This means that it takes a large period of time to discharge the capacitor, while it does not take a long time to charge it. This circuit is required for the Arduino to register the amplified signal value and give a readout of the new voltage. The Arduino cannot sample the amplified signal fast enough to detect every muon passing through it without this additional circuit.The Arduino nano detects the voltage spikes on the peak detector circuit and compares them to previous values in a certain time period. If the voltage peak is high enough (that is to say it is not a small peak caused by external noise), the code registers that a muon has crossed paths with the SiMP. The Arduino then prints the requested info to the serial monitor (# of muons since program start, time, ADC reading, time between muons, etc).The SiMP device is wrapped in tin-foil and electrical tape to reduce electrical noise and eliminate sources of light which can also trigger the SiMP.How does this relate to our course?In our course we cover much of the topics described in the operation of the device. We cover what muons are in relativity, and how their half-life is different from our point of view compared to theirs due to the effects of relativity. We also cover fields, which are used by the DC-DC converter. Furthermore, I recall a class where we wrapped a cell phone in tin-foil to kill the signal. This is the same concept as wrapping the SiMP circuit in foil to eliminate interference.This project also builds upon the fundamentals of the physics curriculum. It helps students learn by experiencing instead of listening to concepts and memorizing equations.Experiment  Connect muon detector to the computer.  Place muon in desired location.  Leave detector running for 10 minutes (600 seconds)  Stop detection and mark down the number of muons detected  Divide this number by 600 to determine the frequency at which muons collide with the sensor.

        "content": "SEE BOTTOM OF POST FOR 4-BIT UPDATEPurposeThe purpose of this project is to create an 8-bit computer that can perform an array of logical and arithmetic operations. The computer is to operate off 5V Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) chips and be user programmable. The project will also include an Arduino shield that is capable of programming the Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) chips. This computer should also have an easily readable base-10 output. The computer should be capable of iterating the program by use of a constant clock cycle or manual button press. The computer should use a Von Neumann architecture where all parts share a common bus. The computer should also be feasible for a class project.

Ben Eater’s website and walkthroughs proved extremely useful in determining the parts required and what function they served. Finding the parts was more difficult. The RAM, flip-flop and EEPROM chips are no longer in production and are only sold by certain providers. Fortunately, future classes can still make the computer as most of the chips are still sold through websites like DigiKey.A note on the design of this computer. The computer designed in this project uses a Von Neumann architecture where all the parts interface via the central bus. Alternatively, one can use the Harvard architecture where parts independently interface with each other.The next step was prototyping an EEPROM programmer. The initial design used a breadboard, two 595 shift-registers and Arduino UNO to interface with the EEPROM device. Digital pins 5 through 11 interfaced with the EEPROM directly via the data input/output pins. By connecting these pins to the Arduino, it is simpler to read back the data on the chip. The code can use a simple digitalRead() function instead of shifting in data from more 595 shift-registers. To write the data in the required positions, the code uses shift-registers to assign addresses during write/read cycles. The Chip Enable (CE) pin is also connected to the shift-registers. The Write Enable (WE) pin toggles low after the program sets the address and data pins to their requested values. This step is what tells the EEPROM to store the data into memory. This step proved especially difficult at the beginning of the year when the class worked on a 4-bit TTL computer. The solution to this problem was changing the EEPROM chip from a 28C17 to a 28C16A. Independent testing of the EEPROM chip with an 8-position DIP switch and LEDs ensured that the chip worked as intended.The EEPROM programmer code used by Ben Eater in his project is the basis for this device. Fundamentally, there is only one way to program the EEPROM chip in this circuit. The code works by taking input in an array of name writeData[]. The code iterates through this array until each byte of EEPROM is set to the desired value. To save time the code writes only the required data to the EEPROM by assessing the size of writeData[] before programming. The writeEEPROM() function first uses the setAddress() function to assign which address to write to via the shift-registers. The code pulls high the Output Enable (OE) pin here too as required to write data. Next the program sets the required states of the data pins to reflect the selected byte of writeData[]. The WE pin momentarily toggles low for each byte to complete the write. The readEEPROM() function operates in much the same way except that the OE pin is low and digitalRead() replaces digitalWrite(). Also, the WE pin is not tripped.Following this step was the designing of an EEPROM programmer Arduino shield. The advantage of using a shield is that EEPROM programming can be simple and quick. Furthermore, a 12V power supply can connect to the Arduino and the user can utilize the “Chip Clear” function to quickly wipe the data. The user simply slides a switch and clicks a button to overwrite the chip with ‘1’s. This switch applies 12V to the OE pin and the button grounds the WE pin. When the switch is in chip clear position a green LED illuminates. Unfortunately, the first iteration of this PCB had the data lines omitted and thus required jumper wires to properly program the chip. Version two seen here includes these wires. There was no idle time while waiting for the EEPROM programmer PCBs to arrive. The construction of the computer itself occupied this time and much more. The assembly of the computer took place in multiple steps correlating with the different modules.The first step was the assembly of the clock module. This consists of two 555 timer ICs (as used in 555 Boost Converter). One of the timers operates in astable mode creating a constant, yet adjustable, pulse on its output. The other functions as a debouncer for the manual clock signal. A slide switch determines the source of the clock signal. The difficulties here were getting the clock to work in a reliable manner. Often it ran into problems where it would work fine at first and then cease to function properly.Installing the program counter was the next step. The program counter consists of a 74LS161 4-bit synchronous binary counter and a 74LS245 Octal bus transceiver. The 74LS161 is the fundamental part of the counter, increasing as the clock pulse increases. The 74LS161 also take input from the 74LS245. In normal operation, this does not affect the function of the counter as the output from the 74LS245 matches the value on the 74LS161. However, if the code includes a JUMP function, the bus transceiver will have a different value on its input and the program counter will adjust its value accordingly.The next step was the construction of the registers. There are three registers in this computer, the A register, the B register and the Instruction Register (IR). The A and B registers are the inputs to the ALU. Each register can store an 8-bit value for one clock cycle. This means that each register can store a different value from the bus. Each register of the computer uses two 74LS173 4-bit D-type registers in combination to store these values. The instruction register is unique in that it interfaces with bus directly as well as with the instruction EEPROM and, by extension, the program counter. Because the IR is so closely linked to with the instructions, the first 4 bits do not connect to the bus and instead determine where in the EEPROM the computer is reading code from.Following this is the installation of the ALU. The ALU is essentially the “brains” of the computer. Its function is to perform all of the arithmetic and logical operations that the user programs the computer to complete. By chaining two 74LS181 chips as shown, they can operate as a single 8-bit unit. Chaining works by connecting the carry+4 pin to the carry in pin of the upper nibble ALU. Connecting the select inputs (‘S’ pins) of each ALU to each other means that each chip is performing the same operation on the input values. By changing the values of the S pins, the operation of the ALU changes. The M pin determines whether the ALU is performing a logical or arithmetic operation. Arithmetic operations would include ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, etc. Logical operations use Boolean logic and include NAND, XOR, NOT, etc. The ALU in this computer varies greatly from the computer in Ben Eater’s example. Instead of having merely 2 operations (ADD and SUBTRACT), this computer has a full set of ALU functions. The output pins (‘F’ pins) connect to the associated 74LS245 bus transceiver chip. From here the operation is complete and the result appears in the output section. The final part of the computer assembled here is the Random-Access Memory (RAM). There are two settings for the RAM and three sub-modules that make up the whole module. The RAM can either be in program mode or read mode. A push button switch connected to red and green LEDs determines which mode the RAM is in. When the red LED is on, the computer is in program mode and it accepts input on the 4-position and 8-position DIP switches. The 4-position switch selects the address for the data and the 8-position switch is the data itself. To complete the write, the orange RAM IN pin must be high and the user must press the black momentary switch. The RAM is in read mode when the green LED is on. Here the RAM take input from the bus and outputs the value of the RAM at that address. These two modes work on the same RAM chips but use different sources for data. As such, the architecture uses the 74LS157 Quad 2-to-1 line data selector to determine which source the data should come from. This chip is also called a multiplexer. Both the switches and the bus connect to these chips and the select pins choose which of the inputs is sent to the output pins. Only the least significant nibble connects to the 74LS157 controlling the address. This is because only the address value is only ever 4 bits long (a limitation of the 4-bit program counter). Important to note is that the output of the RAM chips is active low. As a result, the chips require an inverter to connect to the bus transceiver. This is because the bus operates active high.There are still a few modules missing from this computer. Most notably, the output and input registers are missing.The output register operates on a programmed EEPROM that converts binary values on the bus to decimal numbers on 7-segment displays. This works by taking input from the bus and converting this binary value to the appropriate decimal number. The EEPROM, however, has only 8 outputs, enough for only one 7-segment display. The solution to this problem is POV (see BiColour LED Matrix). An external clock can count through the extra three address lines of the 28C16 EEPROM by using a 74LS76 Dual JK flip-flop. This flip-flop will count up to three (four different values) in binary. These two output wires connect to the EEPROM and a 74LS139 Dual 2-line to 4-line decoder, also known as a de-multiplexer. Connecting the two wires to the EEPROM can tell the chip to output the ones, tens or hundreds digit of the input address lines, as specified when programming the chip. The 74LS139 turns off one of its four output pins depending on the input of the two lines coming from the JK flip-flop. The computer can control each display independently by connecting the four outputs of the 74LS139 to the common cathode of the 7-segment displays Each time one of the pins is at 0V, the associated display turns on. With a high enough clock cycle, it is impossible to tell that only one display is on at any given time.The input module also uses an EEPROM chip. The program counter addresses each input of the EEPROM and the 8 output pins address the appropriate control signals. There are, however, many more control signals in this build than anticipated due to the complete ALUs. The completed design will require multiplexers and de-multiplexers to address the full suite of control pins.Media                                      RAM module and IR register    EEPROM Programmer Shield (Version 1)                                        ALU (middle) with A (top) and B (bottom) registers    The computer mid-way through RAM construction        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/aaMhVgkE8aw  CodeEEPROM Programmer#define DATA 2#define CLOCK 3#define LATCH 4#define D0 5#define D7 12#define WE 13uint8_t writeData[] = {0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x0d, 0x0e, 0x0f};void setup() {  Serial.begin(9600);  pinMode(DATA, OUTPUT);  pinMode(CLOCK, OUTPUT);  pinMode(LATCH, OUTPUT);  pinMode(WE, OUTPUT);  digitalWrite(WE, HIGH); //WE is active low  Serial.print(\"Programming\");  for (int address = 0; address &lt; sizeof(writeData); address++) {    writeEEPROM(address, writeData[address]);    if (address % 64 == 0) {      Serial.print(\".\");    }  }  Serial.println(\" done\");  Serial.println(\"Data:\");  printContents();}void loop() {  printContents();  delay(10000);}void setAddress(int address, bool outputEnable) {  shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, MSBFIRST, (address &gt;&gt; 8) | (outputEnable ? 0x00 : 0x80));  shiftOut(DATA, CLOCK, MSBFIRST, address);  digitalWrite(LATCH, LOW);  digitalWrite(LATCH, HIGH);  digitalWrite(LATCH, LOW);}byte readEEPROM(int address) {  for (int pin = D0; pin &lt;= D7; pin++) {    pinMode(pin, INPUT);  }  setAddress(address, true); //output enable on for read  byte dataIn = 0;  for (int pin = D7; pin &gt;= D0; pin -= 1) {    dataIn = (dataIn &lt;&lt; 1) + digitalRead(pin);  }  return dataIn;}void writeEEPROM(int address, byte inByte) {  setAddress(address, false); //output enable off for write  for (int pin = D0; pin &lt;= D7; pin++) {    pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);  }  for (int pin = D0; pin &lt;= D7; pin++) {    digitalWrite(pin, inByte &amp; 1);    inByte = inByte &gt;&gt; 1;  }  digitalWrite(WE, LOW);  digitalWrite(WE, HIGH);}void printContents() {  for (int base = 0; base &lt;= 255; base += 16) {    byte readData[16]; //28C16 has 16k (2^14) of memory with 2^11 adresses but the computer can only address 2^8    for (int offset = 0; offset &lt;= 15; offset++) {      readData[offset] = readEEPROM(base + offset);    }    char buf[80];    sprintf(buf, \"%03x:  %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x   %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x %02x\",            base, readData[0], readData[1], readData[2], readData[3], readData[4], readData[5], readData[6], readData[7],            readData[8], readData[9], readData[10], readData[11], readData[12], readData[13], readData[14], readData[15]);    Serial.println(buf);  }}ConclusionThis was an extremely difficult and extraordinarily time-consuming project. I do not regret taking on the challenge of a completely functional computer, however I do regret pursuing one of this level of difficulty. That is to say that I should have chosen a much easier architecture or simply created a 4-bit computer instead of an 8-bit. In hind sight, it would have been a much better idea to simply adapt the 4-bit TTL computer we made in class to operate on the 28C16 EEPROM. I do not want to stop working on this project, however. I would like to continue to develop the computer until it is complete. I believe that either a complete 8-bit version on a PCB or a smaller 4-bit breadboard version of this computer would prove extremely useful to future generations of ACES. I found the TTL computer project at the beginning extremely fun and informative even though it never worked. Despite the amount of time I have invested in this project and its less than perfect result, I am satisfied. Hopefully my newfound knowledge will prove useful in university and beyond. I am glad to have been a part of this truly amazing ACES program. I think that this project is an excellent way to end an outstanding three years.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “TEI4M Major Project: The Computer.” ICS4U Software Engineering Tasks, RSGC ACES, 8 Sept. 2017, http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/4BitComputer/index.html.Eater, Ben. “Build an 8-Bit Computer from Scratch.” Ben Eater, 18 Apr. 2017, https://eater.net/.UpdateThis summer (2018) I successfully built a 4-bit variation of this computer.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to use the Atmel 328p microcontroller to control the speed of a 12V DC fan. The microcontroller is to take input from a potentiometer and vary the rotation frequency accordingly.Part A. Getting Acquainted with the fan  What is the typical operating voltage and current draw of this fan?12 VDC, 0.34 A  Identify the name, colour and function of each of the four wires.Black: GNDRed: VccYellow: PulseBlue: PWM  What is the operating voltage range of the PWM signal?2.8 V-6 V  What is the recommended frequency range of the fan’s PWM signal?22 kHz-28 kHz  What operating conditions produce a detectable audio hum emanating from the fan and how can it be eliminated?If PWM frequency is in the range of 20 Hz-20 kHz, it will produce an audible hum. To fix this, increase PWM frequency until it is out of range of human hearing (ideally above 20 kHz)  What is the frequency of the Arduino’s PWM signal from it’s analogWrite() function? Explain why.The Arduino PWM frequency is 980Hz or 490Hz. This is because the prescaler is set on the timers connected to the PWM pins.  Can the Arduino handle the Fan’s PWM requirements ‘easily’? If not, what course of action must be considered?No, as the Arduino PWM frequency is much less than 22kHz. A timer interrupt must be used to produce a PWM signal.  What is meant be the term open collector (aka open drain)? To which wire colour does this pertain and what additional component is required to facilitate the correct performance of this function?This means that the output pin is the collector pin of a grounded NPN transistor. This means that the pin is either in a ground or floating state. This pertains to the yellow wire. To use this pin a pull up resistor is required.  What is the FREQUENCY:ROTATION ratio of the output sense wire?2:1Part B. Hardware DesignPart C. PWM DesignThis project uses the PWM (pulse-width modulation) functions of the 328p to adjust the fan rotation frequency. The fan interprets the duty cycle of the PWM signal. As such, the frequency of the PWM signal must be constant and the duty cycle should change according to the position of the potentiometer. Using mode 7 in conjunction with the OCR2A and OCR2B registers, the duty cycle and frequency can be independently adjusted. The formula to convert frequency (in Hz) to a value which OCR2A can understand is:This value can range from 0-255 and it determines the value at which the counter attached to timer 2 should reset to zero. Here we have defined it as 80 with a prescaler of 8 for a PWM frequency of 25 kHz. To augment the duty cycle of the PWM signal, the microcontroller uses the value of OCR2B. The larger the value stored in OCR2B, the greater the duty cycle. Each time the counter resets (according to the value of OCR2A), the pin state changes to HIGH until the value reaches that of OCR2B and it changes to LOW.Part D. Fan Speed (ADC)The DC Fan code uses the analog to digital converter (ADC) built into the 328p to determine the speed at which the user wants the fan to operate. The external circuit is a voltage divider from 5V-0V. The microcontroller interprets this voltage as a 10-bit value which is then converted to a duty cycle value and stored in OCR2B.Timer 0 controls the ADC by sending out a request for data each time it overflows. The prescaler value of timer 0 determines the frequency of this request. An empty interrupt must be set in order to properly trigger the ADC read. In this example it is set to request ADC data 64 times per second. When the ADC has data to return, another interrupt occurs. Only the upper byte of this data is used (as the duty cycle can only be an 8-bit value) so the ADLAR value is set. This is then mapped to a duty cycle value and the duty cycle changes during the next interrupt of the PWM timer. The code discards the first value of the ADC, in accordance to Atmel guidelines, as the first read is often inaccurate.Part E. Sense (Feedback, Tachometry, Yellow Wire)The purpose of the sense system is to determine whether or not the fan is operating as desired. By combining this data with the abilities of PID, the user can have more precise control over the fan speed. The yellow wire changes state four times per revolution of the fan. This wire requires a pullup resistor as it is an open gate pin. Without this resistor, the pin would either be in a ground or floating state. By pulling the wire up to +5V, the microcontroller can determine how often the state changes. The 328p records the speed of the fan by use of an external interrupt. Each time the pin is in a HIGH state the interrupt triggers and increases the pulseCount register by one. The ICES1 bit in TCCRB1 is set to ensure that the program operates in this way. Each second, as determined by the overflow of timer 1, the program compares the value of this register to the theoretical rotation/second value defined in the datasheet. The program uses the ADC defined duty cycle to index an array and determine what the rotation/second value should be. In this array the rotation/second values are twice the actual values because the external interrupt triggers twice per revolution.Part F. Serial Communication (USART: Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous serial Receive and Transmit)By using USART the microcontroller can relay to the user the current state of the program. In this project the microcontroller tells the computer how closely the fan is rotating to the intended value. The 328p first configures USART to send data in the UARTInit label. The baud rate set here is a function of the F_CPU value. To get 9600 baud at 16 MHz the value stored in UBRR0 (a two-byte word) must be 103. To send data out the TXEN0 bit in the UCSROB register must be set high. If the microcontroller needed to receive data, the RXEN0 bit in this register would be set. Note that each call of the USART registers includes a ‘0’ because there can be multiple USART communication interfaces on the same chip. Each time timer 1 overflows, the difference between the ideal value and the actual value of the rotations/second is sent over USART. Added to this value is an ASCII ‘A’ or sixty-five as the graphing utility cannot understand negative numbers (and the rpm in some cases may be less than expected). This provides a buffer between the difference and zero.Part G. Graphic VisualizationBy using Data visualizer tool included with Atmel Studio 7 one can interpret the data sent over USART to the computer. The 328p Arduino connects to the computer via a USB cable. Selecting the proper COM port and baud rate in the visualizer will return rotation/second values that the graph function can display. Part H. PID (Proportional – Integral – Derivative)PID completes the link between the feedback and PWM signals of the DC fan. Often the desired and actual values of the rotation/second of the fan are not the same. PID remedies this by proportionally scaling up or down the duty cycle as the rotation/second approaches the desired level. This alone will never reach the desired value, so PID uses the integral between the actual rotation/second and the desired level to complete the operation. Using the derivative of the actual rotation/second function helps the program understand how much to adjust the duty cycle in order to have the desired effect.Media                                      Completed Fan Circuit    Graphic Visualizer screenshot                                        Close up of tach wire &amp; pot    Fan at full speed blowing paper card        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/PMThd7WUhio  Code; DCfan.asm;; Created: 2018-04-11 1:39:45 PM; Author : Ethan McAuliffe;#include \"prescalers.h\"#define F_CPU 16000000; cpu freq 16 Mhz#define PRESCALE 8#define F_FAN 25000#define FREQ F_CPU/PRESCALE/F_FAN; (OCR2A) = 80#define DUTY 40; start with a 40% duty cycle#define BAUDRATE 103;9600 baud#define\tnewLine\t13;#define offset 'A';.def duty         =r19\t;.def pulseCount   =r20\t;.def rps          =r21\t;.def txByte       =r22\t;.def empirical    =r23\t;.def setPoint     =r24\t;.def difference   =r25\t;.org 0x0000\trjmp reset.org 0x0014\trjmp TIM1_CAPT.org 0x001A\trjmp TIM1_OVF.org 0x0020\trjmp TIM0_OVF.org 0x002A\trjmp ADC_Complete.org 0x0050RPMStart:;.db\t900,900,900,900,1200,2000,2700,3400,4050,4500,4800,0.db 30,30,30,30,40,66,90,113,135,150,160,0 ;rotations/second according to duty cycle from datasheetRPMEnd:Greeting:.db \"Hello world! \",newLine //newLine terminated.org 0x0100;reset:\tcli              ;\trcall RPMInit    ;\trcall PWMInit    ;\trcall ADCInit    ;\trcall TM0Init    ;for adc\trcall TM1Init    ;for input capture\trcall UARTInit   ;;\trcall display    ;prints greeting to terminal;\trcall PIDInit    ;seiwait:\trjmp waitUARTInit:\tldi  r16,BAUDRATE&gt;&gt;8\tsts  UBRR0H,r16\tldi  r16,BAUDRATE\tsts  UBRR0L,r16\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;TXEN0)\t\t;RXEN0 for receive\tsts  UCSR0B,r16\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;UCSZ01) | (1&lt;&lt;UCSZ00)\tsts  UCSR0C,r16retdisplay:\tldi  xl,low(Greeting&lt;&lt;1)\tldi  xh,high(Greeting&lt;&lt;1)\tmovw z,x\tnextChar:\t\tlpm   txByte,z+\t\trcall transmit\t\tcpi   txByte,newLine\t\tbrne  nextChar\trettransmit:\tlds  r16,UCSR0A\t\t\t;read control status register 'A'\tsbrs r16,UDRE0\trjmp transmit\tsts  UDR0,txByteretADCInit:\tser  r16\tsts  DIDR0,r16\t;disable pins to reduce power consumption\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;REFS0)|(1&lt;&lt;ADLAR)\t;\tsts  ADMUX,r16\t\t\t\t\t;\t;Enable, start dummy conversion, enable timer as trigger, , prescaler...\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;ADEN)|(1&lt;&lt;ADSC)|(1&lt;&lt;ADATE)|(1&lt;&lt;ADIE)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS2)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS1)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS0);\tsts  ADCSRA,r16\t\t\t\t\t;\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;ADTS2)\t\t\t;\tsts  ADCSRB,r16\t\t\t\t\t;dummy:\t;first read is not accurate - start conversion, check for data, throw away\tlds  r16,ADCSRA\t;load ADCSRA register to check dummy flag\tandi r16,1&lt;&lt;ADIF\tbreq dummyretRPMInit:\tldi  xl,low(RPMStart &lt;&lt; 1)\t;actually rotations/second as they are smaller and fit in a single byte\tldi  xh,low(RPMStart &lt;&lt; 1)\tldi  yl,low(RPMEnd &lt;&lt; 1)\tldi  yh,low(RPMEnd &lt;&lt; 1)\tmovw z,xretPWMInit:\tldi  r16,(1 &lt;&lt; PORTD3)\tout  DDRD,r16\tldi  r16,(1 &lt;&lt; COM2B1) | (1 &lt;&lt; WGM21) | (1 &lt;&lt; WGM20) ; OC2A disconnected, OC2B connected, MODE 7 (OCR2A as TOP)\tsts  TCCR2A,r16\tldi  r16,(1 &lt;&lt; WGM22) | (1 &lt;&lt; T2ps8) ; complete WGM definition and prescaler\tsts  TCCR2B,r16\tldi  r16,FREQ\tsts  OCR2A,r16\tldi  r16,DUTY\tsts  OCR2B,r16retTM1Init:;\tclr   r16\t\t;alternatives to clear a register;\tldi   r16,0;\tandi  r16,0\teor  r16,r16\tsts  TCCR1A,r16\tldi  r16,(T1ps256)|(1&lt;&lt;ICES1) ;input capture rising edge, prescale 256 (2^24)/(2^16)/(2^8)=1/s\tsts  TCCR1B,r16\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;ICIE1)|(1&lt;&lt;TOIE1);enable input capture and enable timer interrupt overflow enable\tsts  TIMSK1,r16\tclr  pulseCountretTM0Init:\tclr  r16\t\t\t\t;this timer is responsible for telling the ADC to read the value of the potentiometer\tout  TCCR0A,r16\t\t;\tldi  r16,T0ps1024\t;2^24/2^10/2^8 = 2^6 = 64 ADC/sec\tout  TCCR0B,r16\t\t;\tldi  r16,(1&lt;&lt;TOIE0)\tsts  TIMSK0,r16\t\t;retTIM0_OVF:reti\t\t\t\t\t;required to have the ADIF clearedADC_Complete:\tlds  duty,ADCH\t\t;load upper byte of adc value\tldi  r16,FREQ\t\t;set to 80\tmul  r16,duty\t\t;multiply by duty\tsts  OCR2B,r1\t\t;r1 stores high byte of product (divide by 256)retiTIM1_CAPT:\tinc  pulseCountretiTIM1_OVF:;\tmov  rps,pulseCount\t;get number of rotations/second (*2);\tclr  pulseCount\t\t;clear immediately to record every pulse;\tlsr  rps\tmov  empirical,pulseCount;[30-160] rps\tclr  pulseCount\t\t\t;\tldi  difference,offset\t;\tadd  difference,empirical;\tmov  r16,duty\t\t\t;get duty value of [0-80]\tlsr  r16\tlsr  r16\t\t\t\t\t;shift right thrice\tlsr  r16\tmovw z,x\t\t\t\t;zero index of RPS\tadd  zl,r16\t\t\t\t;set index\tlpm  setPoint,z\t\t\t;\tsub  difference,setPoint\tmov  txByte,difference\t;place difference in the transmit register\trcall  transmit\t\t\t;transmit the differenceretiReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “AVR Assembly Tasks.” ACES, RSGC, 28 Mar. 2018, http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/1718/AssemblyTasks.html.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to convert audio input into light and then back into sound again. The project is to take input from either a 3.5mm headphone jack or a small microphone. It should be simple to change the input source of the device. The receiver circuit should not have any connection to the broadcaster circuit and the lights should be the only way to transmit information between the two. The final product should be able to transmit sound over a reasonable distance (~5m) after reducing external sources of noise or interference.

Inspiration for the project came from an episode of MacGyver and, although informative, the photophone represented in the show would not be functional. As such, determining the parts required and general design of the project required more in-depth research.Prototyping a basic audio amplifier circuit was the initial step after researching parts. The first iteration used a general-purpose op-amp IC instead of a higher-resolution IC intended for audio use. This, however, provided a valuable lesson on configuring op-amps for audio circuits. Prototyping this circuit  and modifying it to reduce noise and increase quality meant that the next version performed much better. By replacing the IC with an audio focused amplifier, and modifying the circuit accordingly the quality of the audio coming out of the speaker increased even more. At this point the only part restricting audio quality greatly was the speaker.The audio amplifier circuit is special in that it has a built-in high-pass filter. These filters work by restricting the amplitude of frequencies below a certain value. The formula to determine the value at which the amplitude of a specific frequency greatly decreases is , where  is resistance in ohms and  is capacitance in farads. The high-pass filter in this circuit consists of a 2.2µF capacitor and the combination of a 1kΩ resistor + 10kΩ potentiometer. When placed in series before the input pin of the audio amp IC, these parts function as a high-pass filter. By adjusting the value of the potentiometer, the circuit reduces the amplitude of background noise and improves the quality of the transmitted audio. The largest source of noise and interference is the AC electricity signal coming from the wall power. According to prior research, the receiver part of the circuit needed only to consist of a light sensing device. A solar was the clear choice because of its relative simplicity and ability to generate its own voltage potential. By using a solar panel instead of a photo resistor, like in Project 1. Automatic Night Light, the receiver did not require a separate power source and could be entirely passive. Unfortunately, the low power output of the solar panel meant that it required an amplifier to reach a reasonable volume.The next step was replacing the speaker output on the broadcaster circuit with LEDs. The more LEDs used the greater the distance the audio was able to broadcast. The final step was soldering the circuit together and adding a switch to change between 3.5mm line in and microphone input.At right is a schematic of the fundamental circuit. The area in the red box is the high-pass filter.Media                                      Prototyping OP-Amp circuit    Dry fit before soldering                                        Final Photophone broadcaster circuit    Simplified Fritzing diagram        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/s8sXL5Ja8Gs  ConclusionIn closing, I am satisfied with the results of this project. I am also exited to develop this project further and make an interactive display for future students. My plan is to incorporate the photophone into a reading lamp and add a sound board that changes the audio being played out of the light. I hope that by making this project interactive it will inspire students to get creative in their ISP projects and think of applications for this technology. I also intend for the display piece to be more polished and attractive than this project. This project has helped me develop knowledge of amplifier circuits and fibre optics. While my final unit did not incorporate fibre optics, I learned a lot about how they function in the prototyping stage where I experimented with them. Ultimately, my work on this project has only just begun and I intend to keep thinking of uses for a photophone circuit. Reference“1 Watt Audio Amp.” Amplifiercircuit.net, 23 July 2011, http://amplifiercircuit.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1w-audio-amplifier-circuit-based-TDA7052.jpg.“TDA7052A/AT Datasheet.” NXP.com, NXP Semiconductors, July 1994, http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TDA7052A_AT.pdf.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to take input from the rotary encoder and display its value on three 7-segment displays. The rotary encoder outputs its value in gray code, so it must be converted to a binary value. To display this binary value, it must be converted to a binary-coded-decimal (BCD). Transistors must be used to cycle through the 7-segment displays in order to give the appearance of every display being on at once.

The initial circuit consisted of a 4511 IC connected to three 7-segment displays. The displays achieved persistence of vision (POV) by toggling the ground connection through the use of NPN transistors. The wiring of the rotary encoder is nearly the same as that in Challenge 1 Rotary Switch Monitor.The real difference is in the output from the rotary encoder. Instead of returning a binary number according to the position of the rotor, the encoder used here returns a “Gray code” value. Gray code is very different from binary. Instead of being a “weighted” number system, wherein a change in a specific digit always has the same affect on a number, Gray code is unweighted. This makes it a code instead of a number system. The key feature of Gray code is that between each number only one bit changes value. When using binary, multiple bits often change from a 1 to a 0 while incrementing or decrementing number value. This reduces ambiguity between number states and, in extreme cases, can reduce wear on memory. At right is the bottom view of Gray code rotary encoder, with white squares being zeros and black squares representing ones.The code does the brunt of the work in this challenge. The code consists of three main parts. First, the program takes input from the rotary encoder attached to PORTD and converts the Gray code to a binary value. Next, the code converts this to a BCD value on r17 and r18. Finally the program displays these values on the 7-segment displays using POV. The code then loops to constantly poll the input states of the rotary encoder. In the first step of the input portion, the collect function stores the input state of PORTD to a register. It then shifts this register right, as the zero pin of PORTD does not have input, and the first input is instead on pin one. To convert the Gray code to binary, the convert function adds the binary value of the gray code input to the value of the x register and stores this in the z register. Next it queries the value stored at this position in memory. Here it returns a binary value equivalent to the Gray code. This is because the register stores the binary conversion of the Gray code at the index of the direct binary value of the gray code. For example, while Gray code 0b0011 is a two, the direct binary value is three.Next, the program converts the binary value to a BCD. Beginning at the loop label, the program shifts the input value left through the output registers, carrying the dropped value into each consecutive register. Here the iterate register decrements, as the algorithm must know whether or not the input number is fully converted or not. Next the program checks if the low bit of the first register is greater than or equal to three. The value of this register increases by three if this condition is true. The tens label repeats this step for the high bit of the first register. Instead, however, it checks if the register has a value greater than 80 (0x50) and adds 48 (0x30) if this condition is true. Again, this step repeats under the hundreds label, checking the low bit of the second register and adding three accordingly. Here it jumps back to the loop label. The input value is fully converted to BCD when the iterate register reaches zero.In the final part, the pov function takes the registers storing the BCD value and outputs the according number to the 4511 BCD to 7-segment display chip. The hundreds register displays first, with output on PORTC. Next, the base pin of the according transistor activates by setting PORTB. After displaying the hundreds digit, the tens digit is displayed by swapping the nibbles of the first register (r17), and repeating the steps for the hundreds register. The transistor select register shifts by one to enable the tens display and disable the hundreds display. Next, r17 swaps nibbles again and the above steps repeat, but for the ones digit. In the final step, the program jumps to the beginning of the program and the process repeats.Media                                      Fritzing diagram    Circuit overview                                        Proper operation showing output 14    Bottom of rotary encoder        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/K7AFz38Lux8  Code; GrayCodeChallenge.asm;; Created: 2018-01-15 8:57:57 AM; Author : Ethan McAuliffe.def\titerate = r24.def\ttemp  = r25.def\tthree = r23.def\tthreeTens = r22.cseg.org 0x0000   rjmp  reset;segment table format: ;gfab_cde..org 0x0010grayStart:  .DB\t0,1,3,2,7,6,4,5,15,14,12,13,8,9,11,10grayEnd:reset:\tldi   r16, low(RAMEND)\t\t;ALL assembly code should start by\tout   spl,r16\t\t\t\t      ; setting the Stack Pointer to\tldi   r16, high(RAMEND)\t\t; the end of SRAM to support\tout   sph,r16\t\t\t\t      ; function calls, etc.\tldi   xl,low(grayStart&lt;&lt;1)\t;position X and Y pointers to the\tldi   xh,high(grayStart&lt;&lt;1)\t;start and end addresses of\tldi   yl,low(grayEnd&lt;&lt;1)   ; our data table, respectively\tldi   yh,high(grayEnd&lt;&lt;1)\tmovw  z,x\t                 ;start Z pointer off at the start address of the table.\tldi r16,0x1E\tout DDRD,r16\t\t\t\tldi r16,0x07\tout DDRB,r16\t\t\t;pins to control transistors\tldi r16,0x0F\tout DDRC,r16\t\t\t;pins to control 7-segment driver    collect:\tclr r16\tclr r17\tclr r18\tin r16,PIND\t\t\t;store input from rotary encoder\tlsr r16\t\t\t    ;shift right to get gray code\tmovw z,r16\t\t\t;move to element the gray code is in binary\tadd zl,xl\tlpm r18,z\t\t\t  ;store fetched binary valueconvert:\tmov r16,r18\tldi iterate, 8\tldi three, 0x03\tldi threeTens, 0x30\tclr r17\tclr r18loop:   rol r16   rol r17   rol r18\t\t\t\t;shift value and BCD registers with carry   dec iterate\t\t\t   breq pov\t\t\t\t;jump to POV if there are no bits left to convert   mov temp, r17\t\t\t\t\t   andi temp, 0x0F\t\t\t\t\t   cpi temp, 0x05\t\t\t   brlo tens        ;skip to tens if value is less than 5\t\t   add r17,three    ;otherwise add threetens:   cpi temp, 0x50\t\t\t   brlo hundreds   add r17,threeTenshundreds:   andi temp, 0x0F   cpi temp, 0x50\t\t\t   brlo loop   add r18, threerjmp looppov:\tout PORTC,r18\t\t\t;output hundreds value\tldi r16,0x04\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable hundreds 7-seg disp\trcall delay\tlsr r16\tswap r17\tout PORTC,r17\t\t\t;output tens value\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable tens 7-seg disp\trcall delay\tlsr r16\tswap r17\tout PORTC,r17\t\t\t;output ones value\tout PORTB,r16\t\t\t;enable ones 7-seg disp\trcall delayrjmp collectdelay:; Generated by delay loop calculator; at http://www.bretmulvey.com/avrdelay.html;; Delay 16 000 cycles; 1ms at 16 MHz    ldi  r19, 21    ldi  r20, 199L1: dec  r20    brne L1    dec  r19    brne L1retConclusionTo conclude, I am satisfied with the final result of this project. Unfortunately, I was not able to have operational code by the end of the challenge period. After working on my program throughout the week, however, I was able to get a working solution. My initial code was organized properly, but not operational. This challenge has adequately tested my knowledge of assembly code. It has also helped me develop my understanding of Gray code and a broader understanding on conversion algorithms/techniques.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “TEI4M Challenges.” ACES, RSGC, 15 Jan. 2018, darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI4M/1718/Challenges.html#2.Grayhill. “Series 25L.” Grayhill.com, Digi-Key, www.grayhill.com/assets/1/7/Mech_Encoder_25L.pdf.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this challenge is to create a circuit to light up a bicolour LED a specific colour depending on the position of a rotary decoder. The project works by reading the value of a  rotary encoder connected to an ATtiny85, then determining if said number has an odd or even number of set bits and displaying the appropriate colour on the LED. If the number of set bits is even, the LED will show red. Otherwise, it will be green. A resistor network provides appropriate pull down resistors for the input from the rotary encoder. The led should change colour immediately depending on the value of the rotary encoder.

Positive voltage connected to the common pin and the binary outputs connected to the resistor network. The resistor network provides a pull down resistance for the outputs of the rotary encoder. These outputs also connected to the input pins of the ATtiny85. Pin 1 connected to PORTB0, 2 to PORTB1 and 4 to PORTB2. This meant that the first 3 bits of PORTB represented the same value as shown on the rotary encoder. At right is the pinout of said rotary encoder. A bicolour LED is also connected to the ATtiny85 on pins PORTB3 and PORTB4, where the longer lead is in PORTB3.The next step was programming the ATtiny85 to read the binary value presented on its pins, determine the number of set bits, and display the appropriate LED colour. The program first enables output on PORTB pins 2 and 3 in the start label. Next, the microcontroller imports the high/low values on PORTB to a register using the in instruction. An andi instruction strips the highest 4 bits from this value and each bit is then tested to be either a one or a zero. If the bit is a one, the value on a separate register increases by one. If bit zero of this external register is a zero, the number of set bits is even, and the program jumps to the isEven label. This label calls the green function, and then returns to the load label to ensure constant monitoring of the rotary encoder value. If said value is odd, the same occurs but with the isOdd label and red function.Media                                      3D Render of circuit    Photo of circuit                                        Rotary encoder used in circuit    Fritzing Diagram        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/-HsjXjVvNDY  Code; Challenge 1.asm; Created: 2017-12-01 1:58:44 PM; Author : Ethan McAuliffe#define TEST_BIT 0b00001111; Replace with your application codestart:\tldi r16,0x18\tout 0x17,r16\tclr r16load:\tclr r16\tin r16,0x16again:\tandi r16,0x0F\tmov r18,r16\t\t;copy\tldi r17,11\t\t;mask\tand r18,r17\t\t;test\tsbrc r18,0\tinc r19\tasr r16\tbrne againsbrc r19, 0rjmp isOddrjmp isEvenisOdd:\trcall red\trjmp loadisEven:\trcall green\trjmp loadgreen:\tldi r16,0x10\tout 0x18,r16\tretred:\tldi r16,0x08\tout 0x18,r16\tretConclusionTo conclude, I am somewhat disappointed with the result of this project. While I was able to complete the code for the project in the allotted time, I did not get as many photos as I should and was not able to record any video of its operation. While my 3D render animation is effective at displaying what a similar circuit would look like, I would rather have video that I could use to explain the fundamental workings of my project. Furthermore, my code has switched up the colour of the LED to be displayed; when the number of set bits are even, my code sets the LED green LED instead of red. I did, however, find the challenge to be quite enjoyable. I liked being pushed to delve deep into the ATtiny85 datasheet and AVR instruction set. I do believe that I learned a lot from the completion of this challenge.ReferenceAtmel Corporation. Atmel ATtiny25, ATtiny45, ATtiny85 Datasheet.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of how relays work and how early computer logic was able to use relays before the invention of transistors. The end product also aims to be simple and easy to operate for potential students and their parents touring the Design Engineering Studio (DES). Finally, the end product aims to sound pleasing to the ear by performing a series of satisfying mechanical clicks when operated.The adder is to combine the sum of nine inputs, each of which being a power of two, into a binary output. The maximum sum value is 31. The calculator is capable of producing a possible 32 (25) unique sums (where zero is an acceptable sum). Each switch will add either a 2, 4, 6 or 8 to the total.

The planning and idea brainstorming came after choosing relays to be a main component. After researching historic use of relays as logic capable devices, the chosen project would be a modular full adder circuit.Testing and research on creating logic gates with relays, specifically the NAND logic gate, proceeded the planned idea. NAND gates are important for logic operations as they can create any of the other logic gates when organized in specific ways. This testing and planning is similar to Project 2. Digital (Transistor-Based) Logic Gates, but with relays instead of transistors.The next step was creating a half adder with NAND logic using relays. The half adder is a circuit which takes two separate inputs and returns a sum, in binary, of those outputs on two pins, the SUM (Σ) and CARRY OUT pins. For example, if both outputs are high, the sum is a decimal two, represented by a low output on the Σ pin (as there are zero groups of 20) and a high output on the CARRY OUT pin (as there is one group of 21). After testing this circuit and reproducing it in EAGLE, the circuit needed further modifications to transform it into a full adder. Accomplishing this consists of chaining two half adder circuits together and performing a logical OR on the two CARRY OUT pins. The chaining of half adders works by connecting the Σ pin of the first half adder to an input on the second and adding a CARRY IN pin which connects to the second input of the second half adder. Now that a CARRY IN pin is present, the circuit is an operational full adder and it is possible to chain it with other identical full adders to work as a calculator (that only does addition).  The design and fabrication of a custom PCB followed the creation of a full adder circuit diagram in EAGLE (PCB shown right, link to schematic image: https://goo.gl/cXBRqa). The next step, after the arrival of the PCBs, was soldering the components to the board and testing operation. This includes soldering yellow relays in such a way that the four boards together spell out the word “ACES”.The next step was designing the LED holder (present below at right) and the clips used to mount the PCBs. Using Fusion 360 for design and the Ultimaker 3 for fabrication made this easy and efficient. This step included multiple iterations of the PCB clip design. The final product has an aesthetically pleasing symmetry, is easy to use and is strong.The next step is attaching the parts to the plywood board with the intention of making the final project both visually appealing and easy to use. This step consists of gluing the PCBs down using the custom designed clips and drilling holes through to the other side of the board to hide wires. It also includes soldering switches to power rails, chaining the CARRY OUT and CARRY IN pins of consecutive boards together, connecting the LEDs to the outputs of the full adder PCBs and labeling specific components for ease of use. The final step is connecting the full adder PCBs to the respective switch inputs. The project is now complete.Media                                      Circuit board render with clips    Yellow relays soldered on boards A &amp; C                                        Final Product    Output showing value of \"11\"        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/ibXhrRucC1A  ConclusionIn conclusion, I am happy with the result of this project. I enjoyed working with relays, despite them not being my initial choice in the Yankee Swap. This project had the unique benefit of being a mini history lesson too. I learned, through research online, how relays used to be found in nearly all electronics prior to the widespread use of vacuum tubes and transistors. Through this project I also learned why relays are never used in logic applications anymore: they use a lot of power, are very expensive and are at risk of mechanical failure. I am also happy with the appearance of my final project and am happy that it is going to be displayed in the lab for potential and younger students to get excited about electronics. While there are many skills that this project did not require (coding being the most significant), I still believe that this project was a resounding success.ReferenceLekule, Sostenes. “A Full-Adder.” LEKULE BLOG, 21 Apr. 2015, http://sosteneslekule.blogspot.ca/2015/04/a-full-adder.html.“Relay Logic Gates.” Electro-Tech-Online.com, http://www.electro-tech-online.com/attachments/upload_2015-6-18_21-28-8-png.92993/.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create a clock capable of showing the current time, temperature, humidity and short-term forecast in a clean, sleek way. The clock is to read the time off of an Real Time Clock (RTC) IC, read air pressure, humidity and temperature wirelessly from a separate device, and display everything in an easy to understand way. To display the time, words for each five minute interval and each hour are to illuminate. To display the current temperature and relative humidity percentage (%RH), the first ten columns are to light up and show the required digits, similar to a 7-segment display. A “C” and a “%” sign will also illuminate for temperature and %RH respectively. The weather sensor is to be separate from the clock and communicate with the main clock via a NRF24L01+ wireless communication IC.            Parts List                         2× Arduino Uno      2× NRF24L01+ Wireless Chip              93× Red-Green BiColour LEDs      4’×2’ Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF)              Clear Acrylic Sheet      Piano Black Plastic Sheet              BME280 I2C or SPI Temperature Humidity Pressure Sensor      DS1307 I2C Real Time Clock      ProcedureThis project begins with designing the main clock face. It is paramount that the clock face contains all the necessary words to display any five minute interval of time. This step also requires careful planning of the order that words will appear to ensure readability (top to bottom, left to right) and that there is adequate spacing between each word. Each line must also have the same number of characters, and the “C” and “%” characters must be present only in the far-right column. Creation of the design initially began in a text file, and was then transferred to a table in a word document to add colour. Creation of the final design required using a CAD program, in this case ViaCAD 3D, to ensure proper spacing of characters. Mr. Elia helped greatly with this. The final step in designing the clock face was sending the design files off to be laser cut in acrylic and plastic. Assembly began when the laser cut pieces arrived. Gluing the characters  into place meant ensuring that the block shape of each was clear acrylic, and the inner “floating” parts of the characters were the same black plastic as the rest of the clock face. This allowed for avoiding a stencil font while still maintaining readability. Creating the wireless weather sensor was the next step. This began with reading the datasheet to understand where to find data on the IC and how to access it using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Pictured on the previous page is the pinout for the BME280 sensor. It is a surface mount device.SPI works similar to serial communication, but with the added benefit of the slave device (in this case the BME280 sensor) being able to contact the master device as well (in this case the Arduino Uno). Unlike I2C, it requires 4 pins. See Wireless Communication: Temperature Data Logging for more information on Serial Communication. SPI is the chosen protocol in this case because it means using only one communication protocol to interact with the wireless transmitter and the weather sensor.Configuring the BME280 chip is important so that that reports the values as desired. The sensorConfig()  function configures the sensor by performing a reset, identifying how often the sensor is to record information, and how sensitive the sensor should be to sudden changes in values. It also initiates getCompensationData().The data from the BME280 chip requires processing before it can accurately display the time. This is because each individual chip has different sensitivities to the environment. The manufacturer, Bosch, solves this problem by storing “compensation data” in specific registers on the chip. The getCompensationData() function in the Remote Sensor code obtains this data. The getCompensationData() function is only called once as the compensation data never changes. A special struct called compData stores this data because some values have different lengths, some are “signed” and some are “unsigned”. This was problematic as the datasheet provided incorrect information on which characters were signed or unsigned. by comparing the individual compensation data readouts to those of the Adafruit library, it was easy to deduce which were incorrect.Signed characters use format called Two’s Compliment to store their values. Using an 8-bit byte as an example, two’s compliment has the ability to store a value ranging from -128 to 127 inclusive. Two’s compliment works by accepting a positive integer from 0-128, then performing a bitwise “NOT”, and adding 1. This value now represents a negative integer. The computer can tell that the value is negative, because the most significant bit of binary integer is a “1”. For more information on bitwise, see the BiColour LED Matrix project.Recording the uncompensated, or “raw”, data from the sensor happens after reading the compensation data. The getRawData() function obtains said data and stores it in a struct called rawData. This data is then run through specific algorithms defined in the datasheet, which use the compensation data recorded earlier, to get the temperature in degrees Celsius, the pressure in Pascals, and the relative humidity percentage. These algorithms are temp(), pressure() and humidity() for temperature, pressure and humidity respectively. Each returns a value of specific size for easy formatting and transmission using the transmit() function.The transmit() function compacts the temperature, pressure and humidity data into one unsigned, 64-bit integer, and transmits it wirelessly via the NRF24L01+. The program then uses the deepSleep() function to enter the peripherals into low power mode, wait, and then turn the sensor back on. This function uses SPI to write to a specific register on the BME280 sensor requesting that it enter sleep mode.The clock code first uses I2C to intercept the current hour and minute from the DS1307 RTC. This code is works almost identically to that used in the Nixie Tube Clock project. The updateTime() function obtains this time and stores it in a struct called currentTime for easy access. This function also converts the 24-hour time stored on the RTC into 12-hour time for the clock to display.The receive() function then looks for available data from the remote sensor, formats the recieved 64 bit, unsigned integer into temperature, pressure and humidity again, and then stores it in a struct called senseData.The current time is then formatted into specific words and printed to the serial monitor via the printTimeAndData() function. This function first reads the current minute and maps it to a value from 0-12, inclusive. This value is then used to query the minuteText[] array and determine what text to show for the current minute. Next the function determines if the clock should display “TO” or “PAST” the hour. The clock only switches to “TO” after 35 minutes of the current hour have elapsed. The mapped value is again used to determine this. The final step in showing the current time is displaying the appropriate hour in relation to the current time. For this the current hour value minus one (because arrays are zero indexed) index of thehourText[] array prints to the serial monitor. If the minutes, however, are greater than 35, the clock must display the future hour as the clock will now show “TO” instead of “PAST”. As such the index of the current hour is directly indexed into the hourText[] array. Finally the function prints the data intercepted from the remote sensor to the serial monitor. This includes whether or not the weather is improving, or worsening.The isWeatherImproving() function uses an average of the pressure from each five minute interval over the past hour plus the current pressure and compares it against the oldest pressure reading. If the average is less than the oldest reading, pressure is decreasing  and the weather is getting worse. Otherwise, the weather is improving and the function returns true.While simple at first, numerous obstacles faced the construction of this clock later on. Cutting the perfectly square back plate of the clock and wooden borders of the face plate was the first step. Gluing the cardstock baffles which ensured no light bleed from neighbouring characters followed. This ensured that the clock would be easy to read. Problems arose in the final steps when planning out a NeoPixel LED matrix for backlighting, as the NeoPixels were non-functional. BiColour Red/Green LEDs replaced the NeoPixels after a last-minute visit to a hardware store. Unfortunately, however, the ATmega328P does not have enough ports to control the 93 LED matrix, and as such, the clock cannot function. Painting the clock and gluing the faceplate in position were the final steps. A possible solution to this problem would be a larger Arduino device to control the entire matrix, or (the better option) to purchase a working strip of NeoPixels.Media                                      Drilling holes for LEDs    Soldering LED matrix                                        Testing Main clock module without matrix    Illuminated Clock Face        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/0zP5Rlmc7oA  CodeMain Clock Code#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#include &lt;nRF24L01.h&gt;#include &lt;printf.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24_config.h&gt;#define RTC_ADDRESS 0x68RF24 radio(9, 10);uint8_t addresses[][6] = {\"3g8wM\", \"0Us9x\"};uint64_t data;bool goodWeather;String hourText[] = {\"ONE\", \"TWO\", \"THREE\", \"FOUR\", \"FIVE\", \"SIX\", \"SEVEN\", \"EIGHT\", \"NINE\", \"TEN\", \"ELEVEN\", \"TWELVE\"};String minuteText[] = {\"\", \"FIVE\", \"TEN\", \"A QUARTER\", \"TWENTY\", \"TWENTY FIVE\", \"A HALF\", \"TWENTY FIVE\", \"TWENTY\", \"A QUARTER\", \"TEN\", \"FIVE\", \"\"};uint32_t pressureAverage[13];uint8_t durationThroughHour;struct SENSORDATA {  int8_t temp;

I did enjoy working with ViaCAD to create a clean, accurate final product, and while it may not work as intended, it does look quite nice. This project taught me to always test your components before you leave the lab for a long weekend. While I am wholeheartedly disappointed with the results this far, I am optimistic that I can get this project to achieve its intended purpose. While it was quite difficult, I enjoyed working with only the SPI library to communicate with the BME280 chip as it taught me more about the SPI protocol, how data is stored in peripherals, and how to read (and find issues with) datasheets. I have alerted Bosch of the issue with their datasheet and they have yet alerted me of a change. From the issue with the NeoPixels, I learned how to think quickly and produce a final project with some resemblance to the intended final product. I hope to bring what I learned about communication protocols, sensors, data compensation algorithms and limitations of certain products with me for utilization in future projects.Reference“BME280.” Bosch Sensortec, Bosch, 26 Oct. 2015, http://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-11.pdf.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to learn about low-level port manipulation using the ATtiny84 and a homemade bicolour LED matrix display. The LED matrix is to show a unique and challenging pattern. This project incorporates persistence of vision (POV), switching quickly between red and green to create a yellow colour and code that uses bitwise operators. The animations used will consist of a square counting down from four to zero, then a red dot flashing in sync with a buzzer; a series of firework-like explosion animations wherein the LEDs flash outwards in a cross from an origin; and a yellow sunrise and sunset animation.            Parts List                         ATtiny84 Through-Hole Microcontroller      16 × Red-Green BiColour LEDs              Piezo buzzer      AVR Pocket Programmer              AVR Programmer Breakout Board      Heat-Shrink Tubing              4 × Male to Female Jumper Wires             ProcedureThis project begins by soldering the LED matrix together using the 3D-Printed matrix jig (seen bottom right). The arrangement of the LEDs requires them to be in a particular orientation as to connect all the short pins and long pins together. They must be in this arrangement so that the code can address individual LEDs. Heat shrink tubing on each of the anode pins prevents them from short-circuiting with the bare cathode pins soldered beneath and displaying a unwanted pattern. Building the matrix requires the testing of each LED to ensure operation and prevent non-functional “pixels” on the matrix. Coloured heat shrink tubing added to the ends of the matrix pins differentiate the anode pins of each colour.The code consists of four separate patterns: countDownSquare(), explodeMatrix(), sunrise(),sunset(). Code uploading utilizes the AVR Pocket Programmer.To begin, the countDownSquare() function displays a 2×2 square of green LEDs in the middle of the matrix. The function then uses POV to iterate through a series of display outputs. The POV used in this project utilizes the ability to set each individual port on each individual bus to input or output using the Data Direction Register (DDR). When a pin is set to output, it is either ground or VCC. When it is set to input, however, it is essentially “hanging” and will not ground or supply any voltage. This is how it is possible to individually address LEDs. The function continues the countdown, and then shows a blinking red LED in conjunction with a buzzer. The explodeMatrix() function is a special loop that calls the main fireworks() function with every individual LED as an origin point. The fireworks() function iterates through a loop itself where it fills the matrix with a specific colour, but uses the DDR to disable particular LEDs. The function uses the logical OR operator (see Project 2) on each individual bit (called bitwise) to calculate the required value in the DDR and show only the requested LED. By adding the loop variable to the specified startingLEDY and startingLEDX, the loop uses POV to light up LEDs in a outward moving “cross” pattern, thus simulating a firework-like explosion.Finally, the sunrise() function utilises the sunriseDDR[] array to demonstrate that arrays can store patterns. First, the program iterates through a while() to ensure that specific display values appear for an accurate duration of time. The countDownSquare() function uses a similar loop to display POV patterns. The while() loop iterates through each element setting DDRA equal to the value of said element. Using the sunriseFrames variable in the loop prevents it from exceeding the maximum length of the array and breaking the pattern. To finish, the code iterates through the sunriseDDR[] array in reverse to show the sunset animation. The code then loops through the four patterns again.Media                                      Testing patterns on the matrix    countDownSquare() animation                                        AVR Programmer Breakout Board properly assembled    Final solder job of the BiColour LED Matrix        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/5sFCJA86BtU  Code#define RED 1uint8_t sunriseDDR[] = {0x16, 0x36, 0x36, 0x66, 0xC6};//sunrise value arrayuint8_t sunriseFrames = sizeof(sunriseDDR) / sizeof(uint8_t); //calculates length of sunrise array in bytesvoid setup() {  DDRA = 0xFF;//preemptively enables output for all matrix ports  DDRB = 1 &lt;&lt; PORTB2;//enables specific port on PORTB for buzzer}void loop() {  countDownSquare(100);  explodeMatrix();  sunrise(100);  sunset(100);}void countDownSquare(uint16_t countSpeed) {  DDRA = 0x66;  PORTA = 0x60; //full green square  delay(countSpeed);  uint16_t povTime = millis();  while (povTime + 200 &gt;= millis()) { //shows POV of 3 dots in centre of matrix    DDRA = 0x22;    PORTA = 0x20; //bottom left green dot    DDRA = 0x64;    PORTA = 0x60; //two green line left  }  DDRA = 0x64;//shows 2 dots on left side of matrix  delay(countSpeed);  DDRA = 0x44;// shows upper left dot  delay(countSpeed);  DDRA = 0x44; // keeps red dot in sync with other dots to be displayed  PORTA ^= 0xFF; //invert colours of top left dot  DDRA ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTA2;  for (uint8_t i; i &lt; 8; i++) {    PORTB ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTB2;//turns on and off the buzzer    DDRA ^= 1 &lt;&lt; PORTA2; //turn on and off the top left dot    delay(countSpeed);  }  DDRB = 0x00; //turn off port as interference from other ports can cause noise in the buzzer}void firework(uint8_t explosionSpeed, uint8_t startingLEDY, uint8_t startingLEDX) {  matrix(RED);  for (uint8_t i = 0; i &lt;= 4; i++) {    uint16_t povDuration = millis() + explosionSpeed;    while (povDuration &gt;= millis()) { // uses POV and loop to show \"explosion\" animation where lit LEDs move out in a cross from the original LED      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY + i | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX;      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY - i | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX;      DDRA = 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDY | 1 &lt;&lt; startingLEDX + i;      (startingLEDX - i) &lt; 0 ?

This project helped me understand how the microcontroller interprets the functions that I write to it in normal Arduino code. It gave me a certain level of respect for those who write the functions that help beginners learn the basics of coding and keep them motivated. This project also taught me the “low-level” equivalent of LED matrices, wherein the LEDs have to be arranged in a certain way and the leads have to be kept separate in order to have the matrix work as intended. I am happy to have overcome the challenges I had in this project and am excited to bring my newfound knowledge with me for use in future endeavours. ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “2016-2017 TEI3M Challenges - BiColor LED Matrix.” RSGC ACES, RSGC, http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI3M/1617/Challenges.html#BiColorLEDMatrix.

The transmitting arduino is to gather data from an I2C thermometer. The transmitter should incorporate power saving features. The receiving arduino is to store the temperature data in EEPROM, and display the current temperature on a scale from -20°C to 80°C, on a bar graph.            Parts List                         2× NRF24L01+ Wireless Chip      2× Arduino Uno              Soldered Bar Graph Board      TC74 I2C Digital Thermometer              2× 22KΩ Resistor      4× Male to Female Ribbon Cables (4×1)      ProcedureThis project began after completing the ASCII character transmission project, wherein an arduino transmits the ASCII value of a character is another arduino which displays the value, in binary, on a bar graph. The idea was to create a transmit/receive pair of devices where one connected to a battery to be useful in remote areas, and the other could record data received.Completing the wiring the circuit was next. The NRF24L01 chip (image on next page) connects to the SPI serial pins of the arduino, as well as a defined slave select pin and a special pin used to verify data transmission. The TC74 thermometer connects to the defined serial clock and serial data pins of the transmitter arduino. The shift register on the bar graph connects to a defined set of 3 pins: serial data, serial clock and latch. More information on shift registers can be found in my Nixie Tube Clock project.Serial communication works by first grounding a slave select pin to select the device that data will transmit/receive data; this is called the slave device. Then, a constant pulse starts on the serial clock pin. This allows the two devices to be in sync and always know when a byte is transferring. Data is then sent from the master (the device controlling the slave) to alert the slave device that it is going to have data written or read from it. The master out slave in (MOSI) line is to communicates this. In response, the slave device uses the master in slave out (MISO) pin to relay the requested data back to the device, or the slave receives more data on the MOSI line. Next, the writing of the code commenced. The transmitter uses the readTemp() function to receive the current temperature from the I2C thermometer and store it in memory. The radio.write() function transmits this temperature to over wireless communication to the receiver. To purpose of the powerSave() function is to conserve power for longer battery life. It works by taking a defined number of seconds that the user wished the device to sleep for, and turns off the radio chip for that duration of time. While off, the NRF24L01 consumes ~900nA of power, vs 15mA while communicating. Code in the setup() function serves to turn off the analog to digital converter (ADC) device on the ATmega328p, thus conserving even more power.The receiver code waits for the transmitter to send the temperature data using the if (radio.available()) statement. Received data gets displayed on the serial monitor, stored in EEPROM, then mapped and shown on the bar graph using the displayTemp() function. The displayTemp() function works by receiving an unsigned integer, determining how many sections to display on a bar graph, depending on said integer, and shifting out a number that will display the required amount of bar graph sections.The next step is testing the circuit. The circuit is first placed in a freezer (see picture on previous page) to record negative temperature, and then heated using a blow dryer or similar device to ensure operation at higher temperatures.Media                                      ASCII Data Transmission Prototype    Transmission Circuit                                        Reading the current temperature on the receiver serial monitor    Bar graph representation of the current temperature        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/j7pRdEejH2Q  CodeTransmitter Code//UNO TRANSMITTER CODE#include &lt;nRF24L01.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24_config.h&gt;#include &lt;printf.h&gt;#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#define CHANNEL 106#define TEMPSENSORADDRESS 72int8_t currentTemp;RF24 radio(7, 8);byte addresses[][6] = {\"1Node\", \"2Node\"};void setup() {  // initialize libraries  radio.begin();  Serial.begin(9600);  Wire.begin();  //turn off the ADC to conserve power  ACSR = B10000000;  ADCSRA = ADCSRA &amp; B01111111;  DIDR0 = DIDR0 | B00111111;  // set radio settings  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_LOW);  radio.setChannel(CHANNEL);  // select addresses to read and write from  radio.openWritingPipe(addresses[0]);  radio.openReadingPipe(1, addresses[1]);}void loop() {  currentTemp = readTemp();  radio.write(&amp;currentTemp, sizeof(int8_t));  powerSave(7); // enter low power mode for 7 seconds}void powerSave(uint32_t powerOffPeriod) {  radio.powerDown();  delay(powerOffPeriod * 1000);  radio.powerUp();  delay(6); // delay as radio boots}int8_t readTemp() {  // prepare wire library to read from temperature sensor  Wire.beginTransmission(TEMPSENSORADDRESS);  Wire.write(0);  Wire.endTransmission();  // read temperature from sensor  Wire.requestFrom(TEMPSENSORADDRESS, 1);  while (!Wire.available());  return Wire.read();}Receiver Code//UNO RECEIVER CODE#include &lt;nRF24L01.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24.h&gt;#include &lt;RF24_config.h&gt;#include &lt;printf.h&gt;#include &lt;EEPROM.h&gt;#define CHANNEL 106#define DATAPIN 4#define LATCHPIN 3#define CLKPIN 2int8_t receivedData;uint8_t eepromAddress;RF24 radio(7, 8);uint8_t wirelessAddresses[][6] = {\"1Node\", \"2Node\"};void setup() {  // initalize shift register pins  pinMode(DATAPIN, OUTPUT);  pinMode(LATCHPIN, OUTPUT);  pinMode(CLKPIN, OUTPUT);  // initialize libraries Serial.begin(9600);  radio.begin();  // set radio settings  radio.setPALevel(RF24_PA_LOW);  radio.setChannel(CHANNEL);  // select addresses to read and write from  radio.openWritingPipe(wirelessAddresses[1]);  radio.openReadingPipe(1, wirelessAddresses[0]);  radio.startListening();}void loop() {  // whenever a tempature is available  // place into eeprom and display it on bargraph  if (radio.available()) {    radio.read(&amp;receivedData, 1);    Serial.println(receivedData);    if (eepromAddress == EEPROM.length()) eepromAddress = 0;    EEPROM.write(eepromAddress, receivedData);    eepromAddress++;    displayTemp(map(receivedData, -20, 80, 0, 8));  }}void displayTemp (uint8_t data) {  uint8_t shiftData = 0;  for (uint8_t n = 0; n &lt; data; n ++) shiftData |= (1 &lt;&lt; n);  shiftOut(DATAPIN, CLKPIN, LSBFIRST, shiftData);  digitalWrite(LATCHPIN, HIGH);  digitalWrite(LATCHPIN, LOW);}ConclusionIn conclusion, this project was a success. While our (Tim Morland and I) original goal was to have the ATTiny85 as a transmitter chip, we found that using the UNO provided more possibilities for data collection. Thus, we are happy with our decision to switch to the UNO. We learned quite a lot about how to use the NRF24L01 wireless chip works and what you can do with it, like shutting it off to use minimal power, for example. We spent hours in the lab and an entire day working on this project, and are satisfied with the final result.  We do not believe that any of this time was not worth the final result. I intend to extend my knowledge of the NRF24L01 chip in the future, maybe by incorporating it into an ISP or some other project.ReferenceLogush, Oliver. “Wireless Lesson.” ACES, RSGC, http://mail.rsgc.on.ca/~ologush/WirelessLesson.html.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create a clock that displays the current time, in a 24h format, on 4 nixie tubes. The clock is to show the accurate time, despite power loss, and have only one power supply.

Next, the idea developed a true project with the purchase of nixie tubes and BCD chips on eBay. The creation of a possible schematic occurred as the parts were in the mail. The schematic in question contained a boost converter circuit as well as the nixie tube and driver circuitry. The boost converter in the original circuit was not successful as the capacitors inside the MOSFET interfered with the PWM signal of the ATmega328P and fried it. Next was building a 555 boost converter, which increased voltage to desired levels, but could not sustain load. Instead, an eBay boost converter specifically designed for nixie tubes was purchased.Code writing started as soon as the nixie tubes and BCD chips arrived. The programming of the chronodot started the adventure into coding a clock. First, the code calls the hex data for the current hour minute and second from the chronodot using the Wire.read() function.The readTime function formats this data into a human-readable decimal value. Next, the decimal values get fed into the timeData function. This function takes the decimal values and, using the toNibble function, creates a 16 digit long string of 1s and 0s. Each digit in the string represents an output on the shift register and each group of 4 digits, or binary nibble, represents a digit on the clock. The toNibble function takes the binary value of a digit and creates a string exactly 4 digits long.After formatting the current time in a way that the shift registers and BCD chips can read, the shiftTime function sends this data out. The shiftTime function runs through an entire string and sends the corresponding data to the shift registers.Shift registers use 3 pins to receive information from a device like the ATMega 328P. These pins are the serial data, serial clock and latch pins. The shift register indexes a “1” in its memory when the serial data pin is high and, after that, the serial clock pin is high. If the serial data pin is low and the serial clock pin has been set to high, the shift register indexes a “0”. Finally, after receiving all the desired data, the latch pin is set high and the outputs of the shift register change to reflect the data received. The shiftTime function reads the string of 1s and 0s representing the current time and sends this data to the shift registers.These shift registers connect to К155ИД1 (K155ID1) binary to decimal converter chips. These chips take the binary nibble and ground the appropriate output pins. The pins ground incoming current because they are specially designed for ИН-14 (IN-14) nixie tubes, which have a common anode.Nixie tubes work by lighting a filament inside a glass chamber filled with gas. This gas often consists of neon and some mercury or argon. They need 150V-170V to run and can run off AC or DC. The digits are completely separate from each other and, as such, multiple digits can appear concurrently as in the picture to the right. These specific tubes were manufactured in the USSR and used as numerical displays before the invention of the 7 segment layout.The final additions to the code were a daylight savings time switch and the cycleTubes function. The DST switch allows for a user to efficiently move the hour forward and back on demand. The cycleTubes function gets called every hour, on the hour, to prevent cathode poisoning on the nixie tubes. Cathode poisoning occurs when a digit is on for a prolonged period of time. The coating on this digit sprays onto nearby digits resulting in dimmer patches and less clear numbers. Cycling through all the possible displays once an hour, prevents this.The final addition was the boost converter to power the nixies. Each tube was individually tested for operation and connected to the circuit. A 47KΩ resistor placed on the anodes of each tube to prevents high current from frying the BCD chips. The addition of a 5V voltage regulator allowed the logical components and the nixies to share the same singular power source. The clock was now complete.Media                                      Demonstrating the layering of digits on a Nixie Tube. \"6\" is illuminated here.    130V-170V DC Boost Converter Circuit                                        Accurate time displaying on the clock    Nixie tubes at night        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/cuN6FGU5eqE  CodeMain Clock Code//Name: Ethan McAuliffe//Date: 2016-12-17//Project: Nixie Tube Clock//Status: Functional and Tested//Libraries#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;//Constants#define serial 2#define latch 3#define clk 4#define DSTPin 9#define rtc 0x68//VariablesString currentTime; // current time formatted for the shift registersint8_t daylight; //daylight savings offsetuint8_t cHour; //current houruint8_t cMinute; //current minuteuint8_t cSecond;  //current secondvoid setup() {  Wire.begin();  pinMode(serial, OUTPUT);  pinMode(latch, OUTPUT);  pinMode(clk, OUTPUT);  pinMode(DSTPin, INPUT_PULLUP);}void loop() {  //Interface with the RTC  Wire.beginTransmission(rtc);  Wire.write(0); //prepare rtc to be read from  Wire.endTransmission();  Wire.requestFrom(rtc, 7);  while (Wire.available() == 0);  //read current  minute and hour  cSecond = readTime(Wire.read());//second  cMinute = readTime(Wire.read() &amp; 0x7f); //minute  cHour = readTime(Wire.read() &amp; 0x3f); //hour  //if the daylight savings time switch is on, add add 1 hour to the current time  digitalRead(DSTPin) == LOW ?

I enjoyed working with even higher voltages than my previous project, despite being shocked more than a few times. It was fun to learn how to use niche devices to create a device that we use multiple times a day. I also learned some electronic history by reading up on nixie tubes and why they were used. I fully intend to extend this project further and create a custom circuit board using EAGLE as well as designing an enclosure using ViaCAD. I also intend to finally decode the mystery of boost converters (although I believe I know where I went wrong). I put an immense amount of time into this project, but I do not believe that any of it was wasted. I am very much satisfied with my final product.ReferenceAlberto. “ATMEGA328 &amp; Arduino Pinout Diagram.” PighiXXX, 18 Feb. 2013, http://v.gd/miZ3gY.Boxall, John. “Using DS1307 and DS3231 Real-Time Clock Modules with Arduino.” Tronixstuff, Tronixlabs, 1 Dec. 2014, http://tronixstuff.com/2014/12/01/tutorial-using-ds1307-and-ds3231-real-time-clock-modules-with-arduino/.Harrison, Mike. “Nixie Power Supply.” Mike’s Electric Stuff, http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/nixpsu.html.“IN-14 (ИН-14) Datasheet.” TubeHobby, Gazotron, http://tubehobby.com/datasheets/in14.pdf.“K155ID1 (К155ИД1) Datasheet.” TubeHobby, CCCP, http://tubehobby.com/datasheets/k155id1.pdf.Onno. “Neon Nostalgia.” Neon Nostalgia, 20 Oct. 2000, http://www.glowbug.nl/neon/index.html.Urbach, Claus-Dieter. “FAQ Nixietubes.” NixieClocks.de, http://www.nixieclocks.de/FAQ_Nixietubes.pdf.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this challenge was to create a circuit that incorporated the 555 timer IC in some way. The purpose of the circuit outlined in this report is to take an input voltage and increase it to a desired output voltage. This is called a “boost converter”. The design is intended for a maximum output of ~50V DC. A boost converter with a higher maximum output voltage can be used to drive devices like light bulbs (120V) and nixie tubes(170-200V).            Parts List                         555 Timer IC      8 Pin DIP IC Socket              1mF Capacitor      10pF Capacitor              2× 1KΩ Resistor      10KΩ Resistor              100µH Inductor      IRF540 N-Channel MOSFET              BS170 N-Channel MOSFET      1N5822 Schottky diode              470µF Capacitor      1µF Capacitor              33KΩ Potentiometer      2.2KΩ Resistor              ½ size Perma-Proto Breadboard             ProcedureThis challenge started with a search for a 555 timer IC circuit that was both challenging and practical. After much research into switch mode power supplies, the selected circuit was a 555 boost converter.Following the instructions of a circuit diagram found online, the prototyping stage began. The first step was creating a prototype on a virtual breadboard using Fritzing. This allowed for many redesigns to make it smaller and more efficient.The following step was transferring this design to a real breadboard. First up was wiring the 555 timer IC, in astable mode, using varying sizes of resistors and capacitors to determine the frequency of the output. The output of the 555 connected to the first N-channel MOSFET. The MOSFET, when closed, created a short circuit between the inductor and ground formed.The high current from a short circuit charged up the electromagnetic field of the inductor. When the MOSFET closed again, the electromagnetic field collapsed into the capacitors. A diode prevented the caps from discharging back into the inductor, forcing them to discharge only through the output wire. Next was wiring a voltage divider, consisting of a potentiometer and a resistor, to the output voltage. This connected to another MOSFET that fed back to the 555 timer IC. Rotating the potentiometer allowed for control over the frequency of the 555 and, by extension, the output voltage.Finally, the prototype needed testing. The circuit passed; an input of 10v provided an output of more than 30v when under no load. A 100µH inductor replaced the home-made coil, allowing for as much as 50v output, the maximum safe output of the circuit, with a mere 4v input.The final step was soldering the circuit to a perma-proto breadboard. This proved to be much more challenging than anticipated. First was completing a dry-fit of the components, as seen partially complete in the picture here. After soldering all of the components to their respective locations on the breadboard, the boost converter was tested again. It failed to work and drew a large amount of current at a low voltage. The solution to this problem was finding the short-circuit and correcting it. Following was another round of testing the circuit. It still did not work correctly. Next was realising the failure, purchasing replacement parts and redesigning the project for a smaller breadboard in Fritzing. After soldering again and testing again, the circuit still did not work. A solution was not found.Media                                      Fritzing Diagram — Prototype #2    DMM Registering 50 V DC                                        Breadboard Prototype #1    Soldered Prototype #1        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/dRn3iXajfNs  ConclusionIn conclusion, I found this project to be very fun, but also challenging. I enjoyed working with higher voltages and learning about their applications. Charging up capacitors to 50v and then discharging them to make a loud bang was especially fun. It was satisfying learning how to use the 555 timer IC and the different ways it can be used. I found the soldering part challenging because I could not get the circuit to work properly. I put a lot of time into this project, especially during the troubleshooting stage. While I was unsuccessful in my final result, I feel that this project was entirely worth the effort.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “2016-17 TEI3M Challenges.” RSGC ACES, RSGC, http://darcy.rsgc.on.ca/ACES/TEI3M/1617/Challenges.html#2.Galanopoulos, Kostas. “555 Boost Converter Circuit.” University of Patras, http://students.ceid.upatras.gr/~galanopu/555_circ.png.Greatscottlab. “Electronic Basics #12: Coils / Inductors (Part 1).” YouTube, YouTube, 17 May 2015, http://youtube.com/watch?v=kdrP9WbJIb8.",

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this circuit is to display the distance an object is from a sensor on a LCD display. The display is to show the distance in cm an object is away from the sensor, a graphical representation of this distance, and the raw analog voltage of the sensor.            Parts List                         Arduino Uno      GP2Y0A41SK0F Infra-Red Distance Sensor with Analog Output              10KΩ Potentiometer      1447-ADA Standard White on Blue LCD 16x2              USB Type A to Type B Cable             ProcedureThis challenge began with reading the datasheet and the explanation on the ACES website to understand what was going on in the video provided, and how to replicate it. The next step was to wire up the LCD display to the Arduino and connecting the IR sensor for the code to run on. After that, the circuit portion was complete and the code section began.The code section began with importing the LCD library and configuring the required custom characters. The program needed eight custom characters of different sized rectangles. The next step was the creation of an array to store the hexadecimal values of these rectangle characters. After that was the creation of the desired variables for the program. These included the length of the array of custom characters, the input analog voltage, the distance in cm the object is away from the sensor and the amount of rectangles to display on the LCD.Following that, the writing of the clearScreen function commenced. It used three inputs, column, row and number of cells, to create a for loop that changed the desired characters to a blank “space” character. The next activity was to configure the LCD panel. The panel needed importing, the custom characters needed creating and the configuring of the constant text needed completing. Completing these tasks required the use of the lcd.begin function to import the display, the custom character creation for loop discussed in class and manually setting the position of the constant text in the setup function. Completing the continuously running code was the next step. The iRead variable created earlier stored the reading of the analog voltage from pin A0 on the Arduino. The map function converted this reading to the distance, which was, in cm, the distance the object was away from the sensor. The disp variable divided this map function in 4 to determine the amount of rectangles to display on a scale of one to eight. The next step was adding a for loop to progressively show to number of rectangles based on the disp variable. After adding the delay function and the clearScreen functions to remove the variables, the code was finished.Media                                      Fritzing Diagram    Picture of the Distance Sensor Circuit                                        Picture of LCD with no object in front of sensor    Picture of LCD with paper very close to sensor        Link to YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/H-DXkPjyVYc  Code//Name: Ethan McAuliffe//Date: 2016-10-21//Project: Distance Sensor Challenge#include &lt;LiquidCrystal.h&gt;LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12);uint8_t customs[] [8] = {  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x0, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  },  {    0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f, 0x1f  }};byte numCustom = sizeof(customs) &gt;&gt; 3;uint16_t iRead = 0;byte distance = 0;byte disp = 0;void clearScreen(byte col, byte row, byte numCells) { //function to clear requested number of cells in requested position  lcd.setCursor(col, row);  for (byte i = 0; i &lt; numCells; i++) {    lcd.print(\" \");  }}void setup() {  lcd.begin(16, 2);  for (byte i = 0; i &lt; numCustom; i++) {//creates custom rectangle characters    lcd.createChar(i + 1, customs[i]);  }  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);  lcd.print(\"Read:\");  lcd.setCursor(9, 0);  lcd.print(\"Dist:\");  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);  lcd.print(\"Disp:\");}void loop() {  // clear inputs  clearScreen(5, 0, 4); //clears raw analog data  clearScreen(14, 0, 2);//clears distance in cm  clearScreen(5, 1, disp);//clears required distance rectangles  //read and map inputs  iRead = analogRead(0);  distance = map(min(iRead,634), 0, 634, 32, 3);//min function removes input above 3.1V  //determine the number of bars to be shown  disp = (distance / 4);  // output  lcd.setCursor(5, 0);  lcd.print(iRead);//print raw analog read  lcd.setCursor(14, 0);  lcd.print(distance);//print distance in cm  lcd.setCursor(5, 1);  for (byte i = 0; i &lt; disp; i++) {    lcd.write(i + 1);                //prints distance graph characters  }  delay(500);//allows time for a human to read the data on the screen}ConclusionIn conclusion, this challenge taught me how to apply the information I learned in class. A large portion of the code that I wrote had already been written in the demonstrations we completed in class. I believe that this project was useful for testing if I was able to comprehend what was being taught in class. I learned how to use the infra-red distance sensor provided to read the distance an object is away in cm. The circuit and code, when configured properly, are successful at completing their purpose.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “RSGC ACES. 2016/17 TEI3M Challenge 1.” YouTube. YouTube, 21 Oct. 2016.

The inspiration for the project would eventually come to light late at night surfing the web. The project idea was then submitted to Mr. D’Arcy as an ISP proposal and approved.Production on the string and weights demonstration of logic gates began first. Next, creation of an outline to base the rest of the project off commenced. When that was complete, purchasing of the necessary supplies followed. Sanding and cutting the medium density fibreboard (MDF) to be perfectly square and smooth was then completed. Measuring the precise position in which to drill holes was the next step. Drilling them was the step after.  The size of the holes were slightly increased to allow proper fitting of the eyehooks. Verification of a secure fit between the eyehooks and the holes in the MDF was then accomplished. Painting of the MDF would finally start. It began with three coats of clear shellac to seal the MDF. The application of five coats of high-gloss black spray paint would proceed orange stencilling of “0”s and “1”s. Application of four coats of high gloss clear coat finished the job. The board was then left to dry between each coat for an hour and for 24 hours after the final coat. The 21 eyehooks and six nails were then placed in their respective positions on the board and aligned. Self levelling picture hangers were then positioned and secured to the back of the board. Construction of the logic gates was the next step. Construction started with the NOT and BUFFER gates, then the NAND and AND gates. It then progressed to the OR and NOR gates until finally reaching the XOR and XNOR gates. The XOR and XNOR gates would be prove to be difficult because of the number of weights and connections needed for them to work. Another person would be used to fix this problem. Videos of each gate were then taken and transferred to a computer for safe keeping.The construction of the logic gate demonstration using 7-segment display was then started. This proved slightly more challenging than originally thought because of current back-flow and the fact that a high signal would be needed to show a “0”.  The fabrication of the 7 segment display representation began by gathering the required materials (7-segment display, switches,  breadboard and power) and placing them in logical positions on the breadboard. Many designs of the circuit were then created. The final design was then chosen for being clean, reliable and straightforward.The finishing touch of a NOR truth table was then attached to the MDF.Media                                      Applying Shellac to the MDF    Stenciling the \"0\"s on the painted MDF                                        Picture of the logic gate representation using 7-segment displays    XNOR gate using string and weights        Link to YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ53HkrWRAo  ConclusionAlthough this project taught me little that I did not already know, I did learn about logic gates in a new, informative way. I believe that this project is useful for teaching someone with little knowledge on electronics about logic gates. Although I was weary of my ISP choice at first, I think that I made a good decision in choosing it. I enjoyed challenging myself to look at logic gates in a different way. I especially enjoyed using and learning about tools that are not often used in a hardware class. The project, when set up properly, is successful in completing its purpose. It was satisfying to see the work and time spent on this project pay off.ReferenceGorischek, Alex. XNOR. Digital image. Flickr. N.p., 4 May. 2014.

A 4011 Integrated Circuit (IC), like nearly all ICs requires a power source and a ground. The 4011 contains 4 separate NAND gates. The first NAND gate, as seen in fig. 1, receives input on pins 1 and 2. Pin 3 then outputs high or low based on the inputs. Inputs must be conditioned with distinct high and lows. The NGO uses a pushbutton switch and a pull up resistor to ensure conditioned inputs. The 4011 IC requires positive current on pin 14 and a ground connection on pin seven to work reliably. NAND gates face each other on both the top and bottom of the IC as seen in fig. 1. Pin numbering starts at the left below the notch and moves anti-clockwise.The input of the NGO is the momentary press of the pushbutton switch. At rest, the first NAND gate receives two high signals and outputs a low signal. The positive current on pin 11 can sink itself into the IC. Pressing of the button delivers low signals on the input pins and the gate outputs a high signal. The positive current sitting on pin 11 flow. When the button is not pressed, an LED placed on pin 11 will illuminate.The first resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit of the NGO determines how long the square wave in the final circuit will oscillate for. When pressing the button, the high signal from the first NAND gate grounds into the capacitor until the resistance of the capacitor is too great. The high current then moves into the second NAND gate and triggers a low signal output. This means that an LED placed on pin three of the IC will ground itself and illuminate. When the button is no longer pressed, the capacitor drains into the 1MΩ resistor and the NAND gate. A zener diode prevents back flow. When the charge provided by the capacitor is no longer half of the original input signal, the NAND gate registers two low inputs. The NAND gate now outputs a high signal and stops positive current from sinking into ground through the IC. When the button is pressed, an LED on pin three will illuminate and then stay lit when the button is no longer pressed and the capacitor supplies more than half the input voltage.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTest 1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTest 2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTest 3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAverage\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.2MΩ + 0.1 µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.2MΩ + 0.01µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t310\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t311\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t310\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t310.3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.7MΩ + 0.1 µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.7MΩ + 0.01µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t150\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t150\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t150\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t150.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10MΩ + 0.1 µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10MΩ + 0.01µF\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t66\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t66\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t66\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t66.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNote: All values are in flashes per 10 seconds unless otherwise stated\t\t\t\t\t\tThe final RC circuit of the NGO determines how fast the square wave oscillates. A high signal on the second NAND gate travels through R4 and fills up C2 until the resistance is more than 470Ω. The signal then feeds back on itself along with the duration circuit into the second NAND gate. If C1 is not drained, the second NAND gate receives two high signals and outputs low. C2 can now drain into NAND gate four and NAND gate 3 will output a high signal. This causes NAND gate four to output a low signal. When the capacitor no longer provides half the input voltage, one of the inputs to the second NAND registers a low signal and it outputs high again. The cycle repeats until the duration circuit provides less than half the input voltage and NAND gate two can no longer receive two high signals. Adjusting the capacitance of C2 and resistance of R4 will change the frequency of which an LED placed on pin 10 of the IC blinks. See the chart right for tests with different resistance and capacitance.Media                                      Fritzing Diagram    Final circuit on breadboard                                        Using a potentiometer in place of R4    Duration circuit        Link to YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy4HRHxsPOQ  ConclusionIn conclusion, this circuit taught me a lot about how digital logic works. I learned how integrated circuit boards work and how to properly use them. The project fulfils its purpose without fail. From this project, I learned that digital logic still relies heavily on smaller analog circuits. I enjoyed learning how to use tools like an oscilloscope and a high speed camera to see the square wave output of my NGO. It was quite satisfying to learn about possible usages for a square wave clock signal; the counting 7-segment display was especially fun to build. Overall, I believe that the amount of time I spent on this project was whole-heartedly worth it and is the main reason I was able to achieve the desired outcome.ReferenceCutcher, D. NGOInput770W.

        "content": "PurposeThe purpose of this project is to create a night light that automatically turns on two LEDs when in darkness and off when light is detected. The night light must be adjustable to turn on and off with the amount of light in any room with a potentiometer.

Powering the prototype was a 9V battery. The battery connected to the power rails via a switch. A 10KΩ potentiometer connected to the positive rail and grounded itself through the photo resistor. It was also grounded by a 22KΩ resistor connected to an NPN transistor. The collector leg of the transistor connected to the positive rail and the emitter connected to a 470Ω resistor followed by 2 LEDs in series. The LEDs were then connected to the ground rail. Testing of the circuit ensued to ensure proper operation.The production of the final project began by selecting a container and measuring it to make certain that the components would fit.  The container needed modifications to fit the circuit and power supply. Using a dremel the case was then modified to fit the 9V power supply and circuit board. The resistors and transistor were then soldered to the circuit board. After adequate cooling the 9V power supply and 9V battery connector were then soldered to the switch. The switch connected the power sources to the circuit and prevented over-voltage. Holes for the potentiometer, photo resistor and LEDs were then drilled into the container. The locations chosen for the drill holes allowed proper operation of the photo resistor, easy adjustment of the potentiometer and plenty of light output. The LEDs, potentiometer and photo resistor were then soldered to the circuit board.The container was finally pieced together and sealed with hot glue. The nuts on the potentiometer and switch were then tightened to be snug but not crack the container. Any excess hot glue was then removed with a knife. The container was then wrapped in black duct tape to provide a stealthier and cleaner look.Media                                      Fritzing Diagram    Finished Breadboard                                        Soldering the switch    Container after cutting with Dremel        Link to YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Pw1j0X9qs  ConclusionIn conclusion, I would consider this project to be successful in completing its purpose. The night light works as expected and as designed without any issues. I found this project to be both fun and challenging. This project forced me to get creative. I also learned a lot about how transistors and circuits work. The photo resistor taught me how to use an indirect relationship (in this project it was an indirect relationship with light) to perform a desired task. I believe that I the time I put into this project was well spent and helped me reach my desired goal.ReferenceD’Arcy, Chris. “RSGC ACES.” RSGC ACES. RSGC, n.d.
