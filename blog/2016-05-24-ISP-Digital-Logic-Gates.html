The inspiration for the project would eventually come to light late at night surfing the web. The project idea was then submitted to Mr. D&#x27;Arcy as an ISP proposal and approved.</p><p>Production on the string and weights demonstration of logic gates began first. Next, creation of an outline to base the rest of the project off commenced. When that was complete, purchasing of the necessary supplies followed. Sanding and cutting the medium density fibreboard (MDF) to be perfectly square and smooth was then completed. Measuring the precise position in which to drill holes was the next step. Drilling them was the step after.  The size of the holes were slightly increased to allow proper fitting of the eyehooks. Verification of a secure fit between the eyehooks and the holes in the MDF was then accomplished. Painting of the MDF would finally start. It began with three coats of clear shellac to seal the MDF. The application of five coats of high-gloss black spray paint would proceed orange stencilling of &quot;0&quot;s and &quot;1&quot;s. Application of four coats of high gloss clear coat finished the job. The board was then left to dry between each coat for an hour and for 24 hours after the final coat. The 21 eyehooks and six nails were then placed in their respective positions on the board and aligned. Self levelling picture hangers were then positioned and secured to the back of the board. Construction of the logic gates was the next step. Construction started with the NOT and BUFFER gates, then the NAND and AND gates. It then progressed to the OR and NOR gates until finally reaching the XOR and XNOR gates. The XOR and XNOR gates would be prove to be difficult because of the number of weights and connections needed for them to work. Another person would be used to fix this problem. Videos of each gate were then taken and transferred to a computer for safe keeping.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/ER%20Reports/Grade%2010/Digital%20Logic%20Gates/IMG_20160523_133336.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/ER%20Reports/Grade%2010/Digital%20Logic%20Gates/IMG_20160523_133336.jpg"/></a></p><p>The construction of the logic gate demonstration using 7-segment display was then started.
